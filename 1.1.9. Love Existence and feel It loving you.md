# Love Existence and feel It loving you

Existence is not a thing. It is a living energy
being. Every single tree, every single stalk
of a plant responds to your love and hate,
your every thought.

Cleve Backster[^1], a polygraph expert, has
conducted several experiments to examine
the response of plants to human emotions
and thoughts. He discovered that plants
would respond to human thought in a way
similar to how a human being would
respond. A simple thought by a person
about burning the leaves of the plant
would register erratic movement in the
polygraph recording of the plant! Backster*
called this response ‘Primary Perception’ -
the ability of plant, animal and human cells
to perceive and respond to any thought.

On one occasion, Backster recorded
graphs that registered a flat line that
suggested the plants were in a state of
shock. He asked the owner of the plant if
she had done anything to hurt the plants.
The lady told him, ‘I roasted a few of its
leaves to get their dry weight!’

When you start loving Existence, it begins
responding to you in beautiful ways. You
start rising above all of the differences
around you - differences between people,
situations, emotions, between anything and
anything. Everything merges into unity.
And that is the truth. Everything is part
of one Whole. And love is the only thing
that can make you realize this truth.

In India, there is a tradition of spiritual
wandering where people walk by foot the
length and breadth of the country, visiting
many temples and pilgrim centers. I used
to wonder how they were able to do that,
especially going through forests, sleeping
with wild animals and begging for food.
The secret is that they start feeling
connected with nature so completely that
nature protects them beautifully. Whether
it rains or shines, the animals and trees,
everything, takes care of them. Even
though this may be logically difficult to
understand, it is the truth.

If you begin to live with a little respect
and love for Existence and all its creations,
you will be able to recognize these things
happening in your own life as well. Nature
will simply reciprocate your love in many
beautiful ways.
