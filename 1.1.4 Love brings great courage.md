# Love brings great courage

A beautiful incident happened in the life
of Ramanuja[^1]. If you study the life of
Ramanuja, you will see how he used every
step of his life to move towards
enlightenment.

_When his teacher initiated Ramanuja,
he gave him a special chant. The
teacher told him not to pass on the
chant to anybody and that if he did so,
he would go to hell. Ramanuja asked
him what would happen to the others
with whom he might share it. The
teacher said that they would be led to
salvation. What would we have done? Naturally
we would have kept quiet, thinking,
‘Why unnecessarily go to hell?’
Ramanuja immediately stood on a
platform in a temple and called out to
the whole village. He loudly pronounced
the chant given by his teacher and told
the people, ‘Let you all go to heaven! I
am not bothered about me going to hell.
Let you all reach heaven!’_

When you are deeply in love, you feel as if
your whole being is open and you are ready
to go to any extreme for the sake of
anybody. You are ready to go to any
boundary, as there is nothing to protect
within your being. Your being is totally
open. You don’t feel insecure when you
are wild with love. That is why people who
are in love always do risky things. They
take the risk because they feel they have
nothing to lose. There is no insecurity
about anything. They feel so expansive.
Love gives tremendous courage and
energy. It opens you up. It makes you
finally available to yourself. As of now, you
are not available to yourself. Love can
make you available to yourself.

When the teacher saw what Ramanuja did,
he admitted that he learned a lesson from
his disciple and declared that Ramanuja
had reached greater heights than him. He
told Ramanuja, ‘You are in a different space
now.’

[^1]:Ramanuja - Founder of the Vishishtadvaita or modified duality principle. Along with Adi Shankara and
Madhva, considered to be one of the three great teachers of Hindu philosophy.
