# Three types of Love and their integration

Many people confuse lust with love. This
is one of the greatest tragedies. The person
who thinks lust is love remains confined
to the physical plane. He never rises higher
than that. He has no idea that there is a
higher plane. He remains in the basement
of his house. Sex is the basement. It is not
the place to live in. You can use it for other
purposes, but it can’t be your home. Your
home is above it.

Man has three planes of being, which are
animal, human and divine. First is the plane
of lust, which is the animal plane. It is a
crude form of love. It is not that love is
not present there. Love is mixed or polluted
by gross greed and desire, that’s all.

As our being becomes more refined, we
enter the second plane, ordinary human
love. Human love has traces of
possessiveness and jealousy. Since human
love is grounded in greater understanding
than animal love, one does not simply use
the other person for his or her own gain.
Human love is capable of seeing the other
as an end unto itself.

The third type of love is divine love. It
is love in its highest form,
almost like a prayer. There is no
possessiveness. There is nothing earthly in
it. It becomes an invisible but powerful
force. This is when love becomes prayer
and we feel restful contentment for the first
time. I say restful because the other two
types of love always keep reaching for more
or keep missing something. There is no
restfulness in them. When the third type
of love happens, even sex becomes a deep
and divine act beyond mere physical
pleasure.

In India, people consider the place where
three rivers meet to be sacred. It is a
metaphor because man is a meeting place
of three forces: physical, psychological and
spiritual. When these three forces _really_
meet, there is great joy and bliss.

Ordinarily we live in compartments. Our
body lives in one compartment, our mind
lives in another and our soul lives in a third
compartment. The body is unaware of the
mind. The mind is unaware of the body.
The soul is not known to the mind. The
body is oblivious of the soul. They are
together but they don’t know each other.

The first step of meditation is to bring them
closer together, to introduce them to each
other and link them in a deep friendship
so that a merger becomes possible. When
all three dimensions merge into one point,
the fourth dimension is born. Out of the
meeting of the three, the fourth is born.
That fourth is god or Existence or Divinity
or whatever you wish to call it.
The whole work of spirituality is to create
an alchemy in which the body melts into
the mind, the mind melts into the soul, the
soul melts into the mind, and the mind
melts into the body. By and by, slowly, very
slowly, they become one integrated
phenomenon. Love is the outcome of it.
