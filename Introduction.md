# Introduction

If you are here, it means Existence wants you to be here in this form. You are not an
accident, you are an incident. You are a conscious miracle of Existence. Don’t think this
is positive thinking. This is the straightforward and simple Truth. If you trust this Truth,
you will start experiencing life in its pinnacle.

Understand, Existence is trying to express itself through you. What you call your potential
is nothing but the expression of Existence through you. When you freely allow this, you
will start realizing your infinite potential. When you start becoming the fulfillment of
Existence, you become flowing energy, which is what I call Living Enlightenment. Living
Enlightenment is living with the flowing energy of Existence, in synchronicity with its
miraculous happenings.

When you live this way, you will find there is no personal barrier, no emotional baggage,
nothing that holds you back in life. Life flows continuously like a river, carrying bliss and
fulfillment every moment.

In this book, you will find deeper truths and powerful techniques to tide over personal
barriers and resolve emotional conflicts. You will also find truths that demystify your
relevance in this vast cosmos, so you start moving in a higher plane of consciousness.

This book is for anyone who wishes to live a fulfilling life. It reveals the secrets of the
self, Existence and the world. It is for every individual to start experiencing the ultimate
purpose of taking human birth on planet earth. It is meant to give the experience of:

Shakti, the Energy to understand and change whatever you need to change in life

Buddhi, the Intelligence to understand and accept whatever you don’t need to change in
life

Yukti, the Clarity to understand and realize that however much you change, whatever
you see as reality is itself a continuously changing dream

Bhakti, the Devotion, the feeling of deep connection to That which is unchanging, Eternal
and Ultimate, and

Mukti, the ultimate Liberation into Living Enlightenment when all these four are
integrated.
