    <p>
      Living enlightenment is actualizing the limitless potential and
      experiencing the ultimate as every moment of life unfolds afresh.
    </p>

    <p>
      Living in this divine space is living the best life and doing the greatest
      service to society.
    </p>

    <h2>Contents</h2>

    <h2>Preface</h2>

    <p>
      Many reputed intellectuals including scientists have recorded that there
      has been an elevation in human consciousness in recent times. Whether it
      is to do with the Age of Aquarius as rock groups foresaw or the
      metaphorical end of the world as the Mayans predicted is not the question
      here.
    </p>

    <p>
      The question is, how do we define consciousness? As societal beings who
      have been guided all our lives by moral and legal commandments, our beacon
      of behavior has always been conscience. But conscience is not
      consciousness.
    </p>

    <p>
      Consciousness is the awareness that there is something more to our life
      than the material pleasures that we seek. Consciousness is that tension
      within us that tells us there is something higher than what we see. It is
      the beacon of inner awareness that guides us to a state of being where we
      realize that we are more than what we think we are.
    </p>

    <p>
      Human beings are far more than mere bio machines. This is why even the
      most powerful computer would never be able to replace the human. It can
      replace the mind and the body but not the energy of the human being. It
      might be a fact that we ascended from animals. But it is the truth that we
      can go further.
    </p>

    <p>
      From time immemorial wise men of all cultures have pondered deep into this
      simple yet intangible issue of what lies within us. 'Who am I' has been
      the refrain of many sages. Many did find the answer. Their answers were
      experiential. The scriptures of all great religions are the expressions of
      these wise masters to convey their experience to us. When they live, the
      masters themselves are the experience that we can share.
    </p>

    <p>Paramahamsa Nithyananda is such an experience.</p>

    <p>
      This book is the first volume of the essence of the wisdom of Nithyananda
      that has so far been expressed. Nithyananda has spoken in a number of
      structured programs. He has commented on great scriptures like the
      Bhagavad Gita and spoken to large public and small private groups over the
      last five years. This book is an essence of these teachings.
    </p>

    <p>
      This book takes you through an understanding of why we behave the way we
      do and explains how we can change the way we act so that we are in
      synchronicity with the energy of the cosmos. Meditation techniques
      provided in this book help you to experience this synchronicity.
    </p>

    <p>
      The understanding and the experience that we are one with the energy
      outside us expands our consciousness. We realize that we are one with
      every other individual, however different the individual may be in
      culture, color, language, religion or tribe. We realize that we are all
      waves in the same cosmic ocean.
    </p>

    <p>
      This experience is Living Enlightenment. This experience is Nithyananda.
    </p>

    <p>
      While there is some order in the way the chapters are structured, you may
      move back and forth in any order to read the subject of your choice. All
      chapters are interconnected with the common thread of Living
      Enlightenment. Yet, each one is an individual pathway to the experience
      and not a sequential step. In this book, references of non-English words
      have been explained as footnotes on the first three occurrences of the
      word, and explained in the glossary as well.
    </p>

      As you go deeper into the experience and feel the need to interact with
      others who experience a similar need, visit
      <a href="https://kailaasa.org">https://kailaasa.org</a>. You can also join
      one of the many hundred Worldwide Spiritual Embassies around the world and
      interact with others who are already on this path.
    </p>

    <p>
      This book is an amazing journey into Existential Truths and a gift from an
      enlightened master of this millennium.

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>
      If you are here, it means Existence wants you to be here in this form. You
      are not an accident, you are an incident. You are a conscious miracle of
      Existence. Don't think this is positive thinking. This is the
      straightforward and simple Truth. If you trust this Truth, you will start
      experiencing life in its pinnacle.
    </p>

    <p>
      Understand, Existence is trying to express itself through you. What you
      call your potential is nothing but the expression of Existence through
      you. When you freely allow this, you will start realizing your infinite
      potential. When you start becoming the fulfillment of Existence, you
      become flowing energy, which is what I call Living Enlightenment. Living
      Enlightenment is living with the flowing energy of Existence, in
      synchronicity with its miraculous happenings.
    </p>

    <p>
      When you live this way, you will find there is no personal barrier, no
      emotional baggage, nothing that holds you back in life. Life flows
      continuously like a river, carrying bliss and fulfillment every moment.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this book, you will find deeper truths and powerful techniques to tide
      over personal barriers and resolve emotional conflicts. You will also find
      truths that demystify your relevance in this vast cosmos, so you start
      moving in a higher plane of consciousness.
    </p>

    <p>
      This book is for anyone who wishes to live a fulfilling life. It reveals
      the secrets of the self, Existence and the world. It is for every
      individual to start experiencing the ultimate purpose of taking human
      birth on planet earth. It is meant to give the experience of:
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Shakti</em>, the Energy to understand and change whatever you need to
      change in life
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Buddhi</em>, the Intelligence to understand and accept whatever you
      don't need to change in life
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Yukti</em>, the Clarity to understand and realize that however much
      you change, whatever you see as reality is itself a continuously changing
      dream
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Bhakti</em>, the Devotion, the feeling of deep connection to That
      which is unchanging, Eternal and Ultimate, and
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Mukti</em>, the ultimate Liberation into Living Enlightenment when all
      these four are integrated.

    <h2>Flow in Love</h2>

    <p>
      Psychology explains that thoughts arise in the brain, and emotions from
      the heart. Irrespective of where they arise from, thoughts and emotions
      are inseparable. Ancient scriptures say that thoughts create us. So do
      emotions. We become what our emotions are. Managing our emotions is
      crucial to transforming our lives.
    </p>

    <h3>What is Love?</h3>

    <p>
      Whenever we look at something, the first thing we do is to calculate what
      we can get from it. It can be a person or an object, that doesn't matter.
      Our thoughts start functioning either through fear or through greed to
      calculate what there is in the situation for us. Our attention is centered
      on that object or person.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is possible to turn our attention towards our own inner space and ask,
      'What can I contribute?', 'What can I add?', 'How can I enrich others?' If
      the process is only to ask, 'What can I get out of it?' then it is driven
      by lust. If the process asks, 'How can I enrich it?' it is driven by love!
      Lust is an energy that demands. Love is an energy that gives.
    </p>

    <p>
      To tell you honestly, it is very difficult to define love exactly. Mere
      words cannot express it precisely. I am trying to use a few words here and
      there so that some word will click within you.
    </p>

    <p>
      Love is an intense experience in one's inner space. Many of us think love
      is a choice. We think experience and expression of love are a choice. We
      think that if we want to, we can handle love; otherwise we can let it go.
      No! It is not a choice as we think. It is a basic necessity of life.
    </p>

    <p>
      When I say life, I don't mean just breathing and staying alive. I mean
      being alive at the innermost being level, as a live Consciousness. If you
      can express love, if you can experience love, that is the only way of
      being alive as a Consciousness. If you don't experience and express love,
      you may inhale and exhale, but you can't say you are a live being. There
      are so many animals, plants and other things that breathe day in and day
      out. You will continue to exist like them, that's all.
    </p>

    <p>A small story:</p>

    <p class="p-story">
      A disciple asked a Zen<sup id="what-is-love-ref1"
        ><a href="#what-is-love-1">1</a></sup
      >
      master, 'Does an enlightened master speak?'
    </p>

    <p class="p-story">
      The master said, 'No, an enlightened person never speaks. Only a person
      who doesn't know enlightenment speaks.'
    </p>

    <p class="p-story">
      Then the disciple asked, 'So does an enlightened master keep quiet?'
    </p>

    <p class="p-story">
      The master said, 'No, an enlightened master never keeps quiet. If he keeps
      quiet, then he is not enlightened.'
    </p>

    <p class="p-story">
      The disciple was puzzled. He asked, 'You say he neither speaks nor keeps
      quiet. What does he do?'
    </p>

    <p class="p-story">
      The master replied, 'He sings! His being sings. He neither speaks, nor
      keeps quiet. His very being sings.'
    </p>

    <p>
      Love is the ultimate experience of a human being. When the experience
      happens, we will not be able to possess the experience, only the
      experience will possess us! That is what the master means. When the
      experience possesses us, whatever we do will be like a beautiful song. Any
      word that comes out will be poetry. Our being will be so light. We will
      simply float. Our walking will be a dance. Our body language will radiate
      grace. All our expressions will be of great service to humanity.
    </p>

    <p>
      All human beings are born as loving beings. A newborn baby radiates
      causeless love. Does she know anyone around her at birth? No! Her energy
      is causeless love. As we grow, society instills fear and greed in us and
      we orient our love based on greed and fear. Then it is no longer causeless
      love. It is love with a reason. It becomes suffocating. We start feeling
      other emotions like jealousy, fear and anger. We experience only love with
      a cause, a reason. But with a little awareness and awakening, it is
      possible to reclaim our original love.

    <h3>Love cannot be created</h3>

    <p>
      Love can never be made to happen with just our logical decision. Our
      mental setup itself should be created in such a way that we become love
      and our actions speak love. Our logic should start radiating a love that
      is beyond logic! When real love happens in us, we will not even be aware
      that we are loving. Only others will be aware that we are radiating love.
    </p>

    <p>
      When real love happens, we overflow with so much energy that we will have
      the courage to share whatever we have with others. We get tremendous
      confidence because we know it has happened in us! Whether it is energy,
      time, talent or pleasure, only when we are overflowing can we really share
      it. Similarly, love happens only naturally, never through compulsion. If
      we try to create love, it will be like forcing open the petals of a flower
      to make it bloom. Can it be called flowering? No. Love is a flower that
      blossoms deep within your being and sends out a sweet fragrance that we
      share with others.
    </p>

    <h3>Love heals five types of restlessness</h3>

    <p>
      The word 'love' is loaded with so many different meanings, interpretations
      and commentaries. First, let us leave out the idea of selfless and
      spiritual love. Let us first consider the normal, simple love with all its
      possessiveness, jealousy and all the side effects it causes! Even that
      love can do a lot of good for the body and mind. Later we will discuss
      selfless, spiritual love or mature love.
    </p>

    <p>
      The other day I was reading an article in a magazine. The title was, 'Live
      Forever'. I was amazed to read it. It gave eleven techniques to extend
      your life by at least twenty years and it was supported by statistics and
      survey reports. All the eleven techniques were related to love. It said
      that even caring for a pet animal releases a hormone in us that allows us
      to live at ease with our body. If caring for our pet animals does so much,
      surely caring for the husband or for the wife will do a lot more!
    </p>

    <p>
      The article also spoke of how people die early if they are single or
      widowers and how life is extended with love. It also spoke of how chances
      of getting cancer or depression are less when you have love in your life.
      Even what we call ordinary love, simple infatuation, can do miracles for
      our body and mind. It can give us a deep feeling of healing and wellbeing.
    </p>

    <p>
      According to Tantra<sup id="love-heals-five-types-of-restlessness-ref1"
        ><a href="#love-heals-five-types-of-restlessness-1">1</a></sup
      >, five types of restlessness happen in a person and all of these can be
      healed by ordinary love, by the simple caring for one another. Once again,
      I am not speaking of spiritual love or devotion or selfless love. That
      comes later.
    </p>

    <p>A small story:</p>

    <p class="p-story">
      A school boy fell in love with a girl from his own grade.
    </p>

    <p class="p-story">
      One day he was kidnapped by an extremist group and sent to a camp across
      the border for training. A few months later he came back to his homeland
      to spread terror.
    </p>

    <p class="p-story">
      He entered his village to find that the family of his beloved was killed
      by terrorists.
    </p>

    <p class="p-story">
      He met the girl and they started talking. She told him how much she hated
      what was happening and begged him to stop what he was doing. She told him
      she would marry him only if he surrendered to the authorities.
    </p>

    <p class="p-story">
      The boy immediately surrendered and joined the army fighting the
      insurgency while carrying a photograph of the girl in his pocket all the
      time.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let us first talk of simple, practical love that you share with someone
      for some reason, either because the person will support you socially or
      support you when you face some difficulty or just because you want to
      maintain a good relationship with that person. For any of these reasons
      you may show love. Even this type of love heals you from the following
      five kinds of restlessness.
    </p>

    <p>
      The first kind of restlessness happens due to your circumstances.
      Sometimes, in a particular place or situation you feel restless. If you
      move from that place or situation, you feel more settled. Even under
      uncomfortable circumstances, if you just show a gesture of love to
      someone, or if someone shows a gesture of love to you, things can become
      instantly better for you! It can heal you.
    </p>

    <p>
      The second kind of restlessness is physical. Physical restlessness is
      nothing but a constant tension in your body for no particular reason. It
      is said that all such tension can be released when you express love to
      somebody. You may ask,'How can love take away physical restlessness?' You
      can see for example, a mother who has a child to look after will feel
      continuously rejuvenated in spite of the child driving her crazy! Because
      of the love element, she will cope with the tension. Otherwise, taking
      care of children is not an easy job!
    </p>

    <p>
      The rejuvenation happens because of the love and care the mother feels for
      the child. Any tension or restlessness in the body disappears when you
      care for somebody, when you smile at somebody, when you express love in
      your body language, even if it is just once.
    </p>

    <p>
      When you express yourself through your head, it is called intelligence.
      When you express yourself through your heart, it is felt as love. When you
      express yourself through your being, it is experienced as energy. When you
      relax into your being without expressing, it is bliss! Each one is the
      same energy but expressed in four different ways.
    </p>

    <p>
      So whenever you express love, you express energy also. Love is
      concentrated, caring energy. So naturally, whenever you express love you
      become a channel for healing energy. When you are a channel for energy,
      you not only heal others but heal yourself as well.
    </p>

    <p>
      The third form of restlessness is mental. Any mental restlessness can be
      healed by love. Research indicates that when you care for pets or play
      with children, you reduce the possibility of heart attacks and also reduce
      the risk of fatal diseases!
    </p>

    <p>
      The fourth form of restlessness is emotional. Mental restlessness is
      different from emotional restlessness. Mental restlessness is purely
      intellectual and can be controlled easily. But emotional restlessness
      cannot be controlled by just a few words of consolation. It can be healed
      only when you express love. When you start radiating love, it floods your
      being with energy. When your being is opened to such higher energies, it
      heals the emotional restlessness.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ultimately, we come to spiritual restlessness. There are so many people
      who can sit with others, who can sit with the television, who can sit with
      newspapers, but who can't sit with themselves. This is what is called
      spiritual restlessness. Spiritual restlessness means that you cannot sit
      with yourself. You can give appointments to everybody else but not to
      yourself!
    </p>

    <p>
      Your love for the teacher or the master can heal your spiritual
      restlessness. Many people come and tell me, 'Swamiji, just sitting in your
      presence puts us in a calm state but when we go back home, we are not able
      to remain in that calmness. Why is it so?'' When you are in the presence
      of an enlightened person, you start relating, you start expressing your
      love towards him automatically. This heals your spiritual restlessness.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you observe when I speak, I often give long gaps between words. The
      gaps are actually used to bring down your spiritual restlessness. When you
      sit in front of the television, you are able to sit so comfortably because
      information is just pushed into your being without a break. You aren't
      given a chance to experience your restlessness. So while your restlessness
      is actually supported and increased, you don't experience it and you feel
      very comfortable.
    </p>

    <p>
      But here, if you have the patience to sit and listen to these words with
      the gaps, your spiritual restlessness will come down and the tendency of
      your mind to ask for the next thought will also come down. You
      automatically become receptive and these words will not only touch your
      head, but they will directly touch your heart as well. If you are totally
      relaxed and at ease with yourself without too many thoughts, your being
      will open, taking in everything and be healed.
    </p>

    <p>
      If your mind is calm, just listening is enough. There is no need to even
      meditate separately later. The very listening itself can create the
      experience in you. If your listening is not proper, then it is difficult
      for the experience to happen. J. Krishnamurti<sup
        id="love-heals-five-types-of-restlessness-ref2"
        ><a href="#love-heals-five-types-of-restlessness-2">2</a></sup
      >, the famous philosopher says, 'Listening is god.' Deep and total
      listening without restlessness is divine. That itself is god. If you look
      deeply into your being, the very presence of the master that causes love
      to happen in you heals the spiritual restlessness.

    <h3>Love brings great courage</h3>

    <p>
      A beautiful incident happened in the life of Ramanuja<sup
        id="love-brings-great-courage-ref1"
        ><a href="#love-brings-great-courage-1">1</a></sup
      >. If you study the life of Ramanuja, you will see how he used every step
      of his life to move towards enlightenment.
    </p>

    <p class="p-story">
      When his teacher initiated Ramanuja, he gave him a special chant. The
      teacher told him not to pass on the chant to anybody and that if he did
      so, he would go to hell. Ramanuja asked him what would happen to the
      others with whom he might share it. The teacher said that they would be
      led to salvation.
    </p>

    <p class="p-story">
      What would we have done? Naturally we would have kept quiet, thinking,
      'Why unnecessarily go to hell?'
    </p>

    <p class="p-story">
      Ramanuja immediately stood on a platform in a temple and called out to the
      whole village. He loudly pronounced the chant given by his teacher and
      told the people, 'Let you all go to heaven! I am not bothered about me
      going to hell. Let you all reach heaven!'
    </p>

    <p>
      When you are deeply in love, you feel as if your whole being is open and
      you are ready to go to any extreme for the sake of anybody. You are ready
      to go to any boundary, as there is nothing to protect within your being.
      Your being is totally open. You don't feel insecure when you are wild with
      love. That is why people who are in love always do risky things. They take
      the risk because they feel they have nothing to lose. There is no
      insecurity about anything. They feel so expansive. Love gives tremendous
      courage and energy. It opens you up. It makes you finally available to
      yourself. As of now, you are not available to yourself. Love can make you
      available to yourself.
    </p>

    <p>
      When the teacher saw what Ramanuja did, he admitted that he learned a
      lesson from his disciple and declared that Ramanuja had reached greater
      heights than him. He told Ramanuja, 'You are in a different space now.'

    <h3>Be open - not philosophizing</h3>

    <p>
      If you observe, you will have a very definite mental setup towards the
      people you live with everyday. You will practically know all the dialogues
      that might happen between you and them. You will know exactly that if you
      start the conversation in a particular way, in just what way the other
      person will respond! If you start the dialogue in another way, you will
      know exactly how the other person's response will change. You have a
      virtual script of all the possible everyday dialogues in your head.
    </p>

    <p>
      Only if someone comes up with a new dialogue or behavior are you a little
      shaken or disturbed, and you don't know how to answer or react. Those are
      the only few minutes you start wondering about how to respond. Otherwise,
      you know the dialogue for the whole day. You know how it should start,
      when it will take a turn and how it will end. It is a dead dialogue. There
      is no life in it.
    </p>

    <p>
      The problem is that we have all practically become philosophers. We don't
      understand that life is not philosophy. It is spontaneous flowing energy.
      It is new every moment. Philosophy is all about repeating the same old
      things in different ways, that's all. There's nothing fresh in it. Life is
      fresh every moment. Philosophy robs life of the freshness.
    </p>

    <p>A small story:</p>

    <p class="p-story">
      Ten philosophers were imprisoned in a country. They were kept together in
      one cell. They decided that somehow they should escape from the prison.
      They sat and made a big plan. They got the mold of the prison door key and
      made a duplicate key.
    </p>

    <p class="p-story">
      Finally, they chose the date of escape. The whole plan was clearly laid
      out. They decided that on the particular night, two of them will open the
      prison door with the duplicate key and signal to the others. The others
      would escape and these two would follow after locking the door behind
      them.
    </p>

    <p class="p-story">
      The day of escape dawned and two of them went to open the door. The rest
      of them waited for the signal. They waited and waited but never got any
      signal. Three hours passed. Suddenly the two who had gone to open the door
      came back and said, 'We have to drop our plan to escape. It can't happen
      today. We will have to do it some other day. We will have to reschedule
      our escape.'
    </p>

    <p class="p-story">The others asked, 'Why, what happened?'</p>

    <p class="p-story">
      They replied, 'What to do? The foolish guards forgot to lock the prison
      door!'
    </p>

    <p class="p-story">
      The other nine philosophers were so disappointed that they decided to stay
      in the prison. They were not able to escape.
    </p>

    <p>
      Those who philosophize cannot think of anything new! It has to be the same
      old mental setup. If there is some change or some new situation, they
      cannot think creatively to deal with it, because they are not open. They
      are like a closed circuit.
    </p>

    <p>
      We have also become like philosophers when dealing with our lives. We are
      stuck in patterns of the past. We are never in the moment. If anything new
      happens, we are at a loss.
    </p>

    <p>
      The person who experiences the 'ever living presence' experiences life in
      its freshness. He is also the one who is open and available. He constantly
      experiences the oneness with everything around him. Understand, being open
      means respecting every thing as equal to you. It means considering each
      other as equal and being open to change. 'Available' means that you are
      clear that the source of everything in this universe is Existence and that
      you are available to it every moment. That is the meaning of being
      available. It is recognizing the profundity of Existence of which all
      things are part. If you are open and available, you are no more a
      philosopher. You are ready to open up to life with love.
    </p>

    <p>
      With philosophy, you have fixed ideas, and you become very assertive. When
      you are too assertive, you can't love. Assertion is an aggressiveness that
      does not allow love to come in. When you are too sure and filled with
      preconceived ideas, then where is the space for love to enter? Love needs
      beautiful space in order to blossom.
    </p>

    <p>
      With philosophy, there is no room for love to settle in its existential
      state. If you really want to experience the taste of nectar, can you
      experience it through just a set of ideas about it? No! You need to taste
      the nectar yourself, give it some space, allow it to fill you and settle
      in its existential state. Only then you will know its taste. In the same
      way, to experience love, just a few ideas alone will not help. You need to
      allow it to grow in its existential state in your inner space. Then you
      will know it. Allow it to happen in your heart, not in the head. Decide to
      be with the heart. Then it will grow and happen.
    </p>

    <p>
      What was once a failure within the head can become a success within the
      heart! Love is really a success of the heart that every individual should
      experience. It is easy to stay in the head. It is, after all, a mundane
      and familiar intellect. It requires courage to come down to the heart,
      because with the heart nothing is familiar, everything is fresh. At the
      head level you have a solid identity and familiar patterns. At the heart
      level there is no identity, no pattern. It is an open space. To enter into
      it, you need tremendous courage. That is why love is fearsome for many
      people. It is an unfamiliar zone. With the head, there is comfortable
      familiarity.
    </p>

    <h3>Ego disconnects - Love connects</h3>

    <p>
      If the cosmos is a grand ocean, we are all part of it. We are one with the
      ocean, not individual drops in the ocean. When we think of ourselves as
      individual drops, we feel separate in our boundary and in our feelings.
      This is what is called ego. We become driven by feelings of 'I' and
      'mine'. As long as this separation remains, we never experience the energy
      of the ocean that is love, we can never experience that causeless and
      surging love.
    </p>

    <p>
      As long as we remain a drop in the ocean, we say 'no' to life. We neither
      love nor trust. We don't feel blissful either because bliss is possible
      only for those who know how to love and trust. It happens only to those
      who know how to feel part of the ocean. Bliss is possible only when our
      heart says 'yes', when the 'no' completely disappears from our being. 'No'
      is darkness, 'yes' is light. 'No' is ego, 'yes' is egolessness.
    </p>

    <p>
      'No' is the way of the unconscious person. 'Yes' is the way of the
      awakened one. All the conflict, all the suffering in our life is because
      of our saying 'no'. 'No' is a fight, a war with Existence. 'Yes' is love,
      peace with Existence. 'Yes' is deep accord with the totality of who we are
      - the ocean. Bliss is another name for that accord, that harmony.
    </p>

    <p>
      The way to be in bliss is to dissolve into the ocean, not to be a drop but
      to merge with the ocean. To be a drop is to be with ego. The ego is the
      root of all misery. When the ego is absent, bliss reaches us from every
      nook and corner of the ocean of existence, as if it were just waiting for
      the ego to disappear.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ego is a closed state of consciousness. All the windows and doors are
      closed. Life itself becomes insulated and encapsulated. Our ego surrounds
      us like a capsule. Our ego is like a sealed capsule; there is not even a
      small gap to allow anything to enter. It closes itself due to fear and
      shrinks into itself. That is how we create misery for ourselves.
    </p>

    <p>
      Love is being in the flow with Existence, to be totally with it. Ego is
      like frozen ice. Love is like liquid water. Only when we are liquid do we
      become part of the ocean. Then we don't have any private goal or
      destination. Each moment is blissful, incredibly ecstatic, just going with
      the plan of the cosmos.
    </p>

    <p>
      The mind is part of the ego. It knows how to close, but it does not know
      how to open. To love means to open up, to surrender. It means opening up
      to Existence, to the flowers, to the bees and to the stars. How do we open
      to this beautiful music that fills the whole of Existence? How do we open
      up to this celebration that goes on and on — flowers dancing in the wind,
      trees enjoying the wind and the stars, always in a state of bliss? Except
      for man, everything else seems to be in harmony.
    </p>

    <p>
      Man falls out of harmony because he has what is called 'consciousness'
      which is not present in other living creatures.
    </p>

    <p>
      Consciousness can do two things. It can create ego or it can create
      egolessness. If it creates ego, we live in hell. If it creates
      egolessness, we live in paradise. The whole world is in paradise without
      knowing it. When man enters paradise, he enters knowing it fully. That is
      the grandeur and beauty of man. That is the danger as well, because it is
      easier to fall into the trap of the ego and not enter into paradise than
      to enter paradise knowingly.
    </p>

    <p>
      The problem is that we have forgotten who we are and for what we were
      created. We are emperors of love, but we dream that we are beggars. We
      have the whole kingdom of Existence within our being and yet we continue
      to beg for mundane things. We keep collecting mundane things not knowing
      that we have infinite, inexhaustible treasures within our being. We are
      oceans, yet we are thirsty because we have become disconnected from our
      own selves. But no matter how disconnected we are, no matter how much we
      have forgotten and how long we have forgotten, it can be remembered in a
      single moment and we can become connected immediately.
    </p>

    <p>Love is the connector.</p>

    <p>
      Bliss arises from love. Love is the poetry that connects you back to
      Existence. Love is the sword that slays the ego and merges you with the
      ocean. When the heart is full of love, your whole life is transformed from
      prose to poetry, from noise to music and from discord to harmony.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is such sheer joy to simply exist. Just 'to be' is enough. But we need
      to be sensitive to feel the joy of being. We need to grow feelers. The
      feelers are what we call love. Love feels the joy of just being. When you
      grow the feelers of love, life is no longer made of independent thoughts
      but becomes a continuous feeling. Then the ego starts to dissolve. Once we
      have moved from thinking to feeling, there is only one more step and that
      is from feeling to being. That is very simple.
    </p>

    <p>
      The first step is difficult, to move from thinking to feeling. The ego has
      trained the mind to think so much, that's why. The second step comes
      almost automatically. There's nothing we need to do for it to happen. From
      feeling to being, the distance is nothing at all. It can happen at any
      moment. The poet can become the mystic at any moment. He is almost there.
      The real problem is how to get out of our thinking and get more and more
      into feeling.
    </p>

    <p>
      Just follow the heart. Just love more, that's all! Feel more. Enjoy more
      so that you can feed your heart. Watch the sunrise, sunset, clouds,
      rainbows, birds, flowers, animals, rocks, and people, and watch them with
      awareness. Look into their eyes. Existence is so multidimensional. Look
      into every dimension like a poet. Praise it. Feel it. Be ecstatic! Expand
      your consciousness and experience every single detail of Existence with
      love. Slowly, the ego will lose its hold and disappear.
    </p>

    <p>
      The only barrier to love is fear. When things start happening, we become
      fearful because with love we enter into a merger. This threatens the very
      basis of our ego. Ego is separateness while love is a merger. The fear we
      feel is nothing but the fear of the dissolving ego. Let the fear be there.
      It will hang around for a while. If we simply ignore it, the ego will
      leave us. It is a great day when fear of losing the ego leaves us. From
      then on growth becomes simple, easy and spontaneous. Then <em>we</em> are
      not, only <em>love</em> is.
    </p>

    <h3>Be a lover every moment</h3>

    <p>
      Encounter any situation in life with deep love. Soon you will become pure
      love. Whether it is a person or your work or a passerby or god or
      anything, just encounter it with deep love for love's sake. If you are a
      painter, just be completely in love with painting. If you are a dancer, be
      completely in love with dancing. If you are working with your computer,
      treat it with utmost love and become lost in it. Just be completely
      sincere and completely in love every moment.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you are painting and at the same time thinking about which gallery to
      put up the painting in or how much to sell it for, then be very clear, you
      are not lost in love. You are in love only with some particular thing,
      which is money in this case. If you are dancing while calculating what you
      will get once you finish the dance, then be very clear you are not lost in
      love. You create more and vmore bondage by doing this. Even when a master
      happens in your life you do the same thing to him.
    </p>

    <p>
      I tell people, 'I am showing you the moon by pointing at it with my
      finger. If you look at the moon, you will experience what I experience.
      Instead if you cling to my finger, you will neither see the moon nor will
      you relax!
    </p>

    <p>
      If you become lost in every moment, you become love. Then, when you work
      you work with the utmost focus because you are in deep love with it. This
      way, your very life becomes a deep meditative love.
    </p>

    <p>
      Then you start feeling, relating and respecting everything as a living
      being, just as you are. You even start feeling the other person's
      thoughts. You start responding and relating to the other person without
      him or her opening up to you. You feel the cosmos as a translucent,
      ever-living presence. You have tremendous intelligence. You know exactly
      how to connect to things. Such is the power of love.
    </p>

    <p>
      Real love keeps you in the moment. It gives you tremendous awareness. That
      is why it is so powerful. Nothing is as intense as being in the moment.
      Love is experiencing life moment to moment, in its totality. And it is not
      about two persons or any object. It is just love for love's sake, that's
      all. If you get a glimpse of real love experienced in the moment, you can
      nurture it within you and make it grow to fill your whole being and life.
      That spark is enough!
    </p>

    <p>
      Then you become a wonderful creator because love energy is also creative
      energy. That is why poets express such creativity. They lose themselves in
      love and become blissful creators. Out of the freshness of the moment, the
      creativity happens.

    <h3>Love yourself first</h3>

    <p>
      The big problem today is that most people don't love themselves. Society
      never teaches that it is possible to love ourselves.
    </p>

    <p>
      Understand that unless you love yourself, you cannot possibly love another
      person. Only when you lose yourself to yourself can you lose yourself to
      others. We are taught that we can only love even ourselves if we have a
      reason. If we perform well, we love ourselves. If we fail, we hate
      ourselves. We apply the same logic to others. We love them only because of
      something, never without a cause or a reason.
    </p>

    <p>
      When you don't love yourself, you become cynical and negative towards
      life. When you were alone in your mother's womb, you were completely
      loving and blissful. In your aloneness in the womb you experienced your
      loving self. That is why you will see that you assume the fetal posture
      whenever you lie down with insecurity. Blissful aloneness is your original
      nature. Once you came into the world, society conditioned you to believe
      that you needed people and television to be loving and happy. It never
      nurtured your original quality. Your original quality is blissful
      aloneness. If you get back in touch with that, you will settle down and
      feel peaceful and relaxed within yourself.
    </p>

    <p>
      For a few minutes every day, just sit by yourself and feel overflowing
      love towards yourself. Feel what a wonderful being you are. Feel how much
      you have taken yourself for granted. Feel yourself as part of Existence
      and love yourself for it. Melt with the feeling of love for yourself. If
      you practice this everyday you will see that where you were once hard and
      self-centered, now you have become soft and loving.
    </p>

    <p>
      When you deeply settle down within yourself with peace and love, bliss
      will explode in you. When your nerves are clean, when your nervous system
      is cleaned by peace, bliss will explode. You will start expressing the
      same bliss that is expressed in the master's body language.
    </p>

    <p>
      Then when people love you, you don't feel guilty or unworthy because just
      as they love you, you love yourself too. You become ready to receive love
      from others. Usually when others show love to you, you feel guilty or
      unworthy because you don't feel you are worth being loved. Once you settle
      within yourself with deep love, you will receive others' love with joy.
    </p>

    <h3>Love Existence and feel It loving you</h3>

    <p>
      Existence is not a thing. It is a living energy being. Every single tree,
      every single stalk of a plant responds to your love and hate, your every
      thought.
    </p>

    <p>
      Cleve Backster<sup id="love-existence-and-feel-it-loving-you-ref1"
        ><a href="#love-existence-and-feel-it-loving-you-1">1</a></sup
      >, a polygraph expert, has conducted several experiments to examine the
      response of plants to human emotions and thoughts. He discovered that
      plants would respond to human thought in a way similar to how a human
      being would respond. A simple thought by a person about burning the leaves
      of the plant would register erratic movement in the polygraph recording of
      the plant! Backster called this response 'Primary Perception' - the
      ability of plant, animal and human cells to perceive and respond to any
      thought.
    </p>

    <p>
      On one occasion, Backster recorded graphs that registered a flat line that
      suggested the plants were in a state of shock. He asked the owner of the
      plant if she had done anything to hurt the plants. The lady told him, 'I
      roasted a few of its leaves to get their dry weight!'
    </p>

    <p>
      When you start loving Existence, it begins responding to you in beautiful
      ways. You start rising above all of the differences around you -
      differences between people, situations, emotions, between anything and
      anything. Everything merges into unity. And that is the truth. Everything
      is part of one Whole. And love is the only thing that can make you realize
      this truth.
    </p>

    <p>
      In India, there is a tradition of spiritual wandering where people walk by
      foot the length and breadth of the country, visiting many temples and
      pilgrim centers. I used to wonder how they were able to do that,
      especially going through forests, sleeping with wild animals and begging
      for food. The secret is that they start feeling connected with nature so
      completely that nature protects them beautifully. Whether it rains or
      shines, the animals and trees, everything, takes care of them. Even though
      this may be logically difficult to understand, it is the truth.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you begin to live with a little respect and love for Existence and all
      its creations, you will be able to recognize these things happening in
      your own life as well. Nature will simply reciprocate your love in many
      beautiful ways.

    <h3>Love is different from respect</h3>

    <p>
      Very often, love is confused with respect. From a young age, children are
      brought up to always show respect but never to show love. You can hear
      people teach the children, 'You should respect your elders.' You will
      hardly hear, 'You should love your elders.' That is the problem.
    </p>

    <p>
      Respect sows the first guilt in you that you are something inferior. It
      makes you feel separate from the other person to whom you show respect. On
      the other hand, love sows the seeds of joy and unity in you. It makes you
      feel connected with the other person and with everything in Existence.
      With respect, there is fear. With love, there is authentic respect as well
      as the scope for deep understanding to happen. With respect alone, not
      much understanding is possible. With love, there is a possibility for
      tremendous understanding and transformation to happen. Love by its very
      nature is transforming. It softens and melts you.

      verse on love:
    </p>

    <p>'Love, Love alone can kill what seemed dead,</p>

    <p>the frozen snake of passion. Love alone</p>

    <p>By tearful prayers and fiery longing fed,</p>

    <p>Reveals a knowledge schools have never known.</p>

    <p>
      Any stone heart can be melted with love. Only love can melt your hardness.
      Only love can keep you porous.
    </p>

    <p>
      Respect creates distance between you and the other. Love bridges the
      distance between you and the other. Only because people themselves have
      not experienced love, do they give respect as the rule of acceptable
      behavior. Respect is easier but not real. Love might be difficult only
      because not many know how to go about it, but it is real. With love,
      respect is automatic and authentic. With pure respect, the appearance of
      love is forced and may never be authentic.

    <h3>Love is the root of all religion</h3>

    <p>
      Love is the original religion. It is the root of all spirituality. All
      other religions are offshoots. Love is like the root of the tree and all
      religions are like leaves or branches. Even the greatest religions are
      only big branches compared to the religion of love!
    </p>

    <p>
      Love has no temple or scripture. It is like the roots that lie beneath the
      ground but provide the nourishment for life. Without it, the whole tree
      dies. Through love many branches and leaves are created. But what do we
      do? We cling to the branches and leaves instead of clinging to the root.
      When we cling to the root, we get the direct nourishment. When we cling to
      the branches, we enjoy only one dimension of the nourishment. When you
      become more loving, you will enter the invisible temple of love.
    </p>

    <p>
      Tree roots contain the information about all the trees in this world, just
      like a dewdrop contains information about all the oceans in the world. If
      we understand the structure of a drop of water, we will understand
      everything about all the oceans on earth. We will understand the compound
      called water itself. Water anywhere cannot be anything other than its
      chemical composition. That composition is ingrained in the smallest
      particle, and that is the dew drop.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the same way, man is an atom of love. And love is nothing but the
      quality of Existence. If love is known, the whole of Existence can be
      experienced. Understand that the composition of man is not physical,
      chemical or even psychological, it is spiritual. Nobody can teach us what
      it is. We must experience it on our own. All other knowledge is
      transferable: physical, chemical, scientific and psychological. All such
      knowledge is easily transferable. Only spiritual knowledge is not. It
      cannot be taught as such, but it can be experienced!
    </p>

    <p>A small story:</p>

    <p class="p-story">
      One day a master asked his disciples how they could tell when the night
      had ended and the day had begun.
    </p>

    <p class="p-story">
      One of them said, 'When you can look in the distance and tell whether the
      animal is a cow or a horse.' The master said, 'No.'
    </p>

    <p class="p-story">
      Another disciple said, 'When you can look at a tree in the distance and
      tell if it is a pine tree or a mango tree.' The master again said, 'No.'
    </p>

    <p class="p-story">They asked the master, 'Then what is it master?'</p>

    <p class="p-story">
      The master replied, 'When you can look into the face of any man and
      recognize your brother in him. When you can look into the face of any
      woman and recognize your sister in her. If you cannot do this, then no
      matter what time of the day it is, it is still only night time.''
    </p>

    <p>
      The master can give a few hints, little hints here and there. Then we must
      find our own way carefully, cautiously. Love is just a hint, but if we
      follow love slowly, very slowly, we will be surprised that god becomes
      more and more of a reality. He is no longer just a thought, no longer
      simply an idea, but something that we can feel. The deeper we go into
      love, the closer we come to the feeling. The day we dissolve into love we
      merge with unity.
    </p>

    <p>
      Love is the secret of all religions. In spite of this, people are lost in
      logic and theology. Theology is as far away from religion as anything can
      be. There can be no logic about god, there can be only love. God is in
      poetry. He is in music and in dance, but never in logic.
    </p>

    <p>
      God is not an idea that can be arrived at through logical processes. He is
      an interior experience, so deeply interior that one must go there
      absolutely alone to discover it.
    </p>

    <p>
      From time immemorial, the conclusion of many mystics has been that matter
      is glued together with love. An invisible force keeps atoms and molecules
      together. They do not fall apart because of this invisible force. Science
      has yet to discover this ultimate energy. It has detected a few of its
      manifestations such as gravitation and electricity but these are only
      gross manifestations. The day that science discovers love will be the day
      when religion and science will commune with each other in the same
      language.
    </p>

    <p>
      For now, just rejoice because love is possible. Be joyful that love is
      your inner potential. You can rise to the ultimate heights with love.
      Nothing is impossible with love because love can transform itself into
      god.
    </p>

    <h3>Three types of Love and their integration</h3>

    <p>
      Many people confuse lust with love. This is one of the greatest tragedies.
      The person who thinks lust is love remains confined to the physical plane.
      He never rises higher than that. He has no idea that there is a higher
      plane. He remains in the basement of his house. Sex is the basement. It is
      not the place to live in. You can use it for other purposes, but it can't
      be your home. Your home is above it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Man has three planes of being, which are animal, human and divine. First
      is the plane of lust, which is the animal plane. It is a crude form of
      love. It is not that love is not present there. Love is mixed or polluted
      by gross greed and desire, that's all.
    </p>

    <p>
      As our being becomes more refined, we enter the second plane, ordinary
      human love. Human love has traces of possessiveness and jealousy. Since
      human love is grounded in greater understanding than animal love, one does
      not simply use the other person for his or her own gain. Human love is
      capable of seeing the other as an end unto itself.
    </p>

    <p>
      The third type of love is divine love. It is love in its highest form,
      almost like a prayer. There is no possessiveness. There is nothing earthly
      in it. It becomes an invisible but powerful force. This is when love
      becomes prayer and we feel restful contentment for the first time. I say
      restful because the other two types of love always keep reaching for more
      or keep missing something. There is no restfulness in them. When the third
      type of love happens, even sex becomes a deep and divine act beyond mere
      physical pleasure.
    </p>

    <p>
      In India, people consider the place where three rivers meet to be sacred.
      It is a metaphor because man is a meeting place of three forces: physical,
      psychological and spiritual. When these three forces <em>really</em> meet,
      there is great joy and bliss.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ordinarily we live in compartments. Our body lives in one compartment, our
      mind lives in another and our soul lives in a third compartment. The body
      is unaware of the mind. The mind is unaware of the body. The soul is not
      known to the mind. The body is oblivious of the soul. They are together
      but they don't know each other.
    </p>

    <p>
      The first step of meditation is to bring them closer together, to
      introduce them to each other and link them in a deep friendship so that a
      merger becomes possible. When all three dimensions merge into one point,
      the fourth dimension is born. Out of the meeting of the three, the fourth
      is born. That fourth is god or Existence or Divinity or whatever you wish
      to call it. The whole work of spirituality is to create an alchemy in
      which the body melts into the mind, the mind melts into the soul, the soul
      melts into the mind, and the mind melts into the body. By and by, slowly,
      very slowly, they become one integrated phenomenon. Love is the outcome of
      it.
