    <h1>Living Enlightenment, Unabridged, 7th edition</h1>

    <p>
      Living enlightenment is actualizing the limitless potential and
      experiencing the ultimate as every moment of life unfolds afresh.
    </p>

    <p>
      Living in this divine space is living the best life and doing the greatest
      service to society.
    </p>

    <h2>Preface</h2>

    <p>
      Many reputed intellectuals including scientists have recorded that there
      has been an elevation in human consciousness in recent times. Whether it
      is to do with the Age of Aquarius as rock groups foresaw or the
      metaphorical end of the world as the Mayans predicted is not the question
      here.
    </p>

    <p>
      The question is, how do we define consciousness? As societal beings who
      have been guided all our lives by moral and legal commandments, our beacon
      of behavior has always been conscience. But conscience is not
      consciousness.
    </p>

    <p>
      Consciousness is the awareness that there is something more to our life
      than the material pleasures that we seek. Consciousness is that tension
      within us that tells us there is something higher than what we see. It is
      the beacon of inner awareness that guides us to a state of being where we
      realize that we are more than what we think we are.
    </p>

    <p>
      Human beings are far more than mere bio machines. This is why even the
      most powerful computer would never be able to replace the human. It can
      replace the mind and the body but not the energy of the human being. It
      might be a fact that we ascended from animals. But it is the truth that we
      can go further.
    </p>

    <p>
      From time immemorial wise men of all cultures have pondered deep into this
      simple yet intangible issue of what lies within us. 'Who am I' has been
      the refrain of many sages. Many did find the answer. Their answers were
      experiential. The scriptures of all great religions are the expressions of
      these wise masters to convey their experience to us. When they live, the
      masters themselves are the experience that we can share.
    </p>

    <p>Paramahamsa Nithyananda is such an experience.</p>

    <p>
      This book is the first volume of the essence of the wisdom of Nithyananda
      that has so far been expressed. Nithyananda has spoken in a number of
      structured programs. He has commented on great scriptures like the
      Bhagavad Gita and spoken to large public and small private groups over the
      last five years. This book is an essence of these teachings.
    </p>

    <p>
      This book takes you through an understanding of why we behave the way we
      do and explains how we can change the way we act so that we are in
      synchronicity with the energy of the cosmos. Meditation techniques
      provided in this book help you to experience this synchronicity.
    </p>

    <p>
      The understanding and the experience that we are one with the energy
      outside us expands our consciousness. We realize that we are one with
      every other individual, however different the individual may be in
      culture, color, language, religion or tribe. We realize that we are all
      waves in the same cosmic ocean.
    </p>

    <p>
      This experience is Living Enlightenment. This experience is Nithyananda.
    </p>

    <p>
      While there is some order in the way the chapters are structured, you may
      move back and forth in any order to read the subject of your choice. All
      chapters are interconnected with the common thread of Living
      Enlightenment. Yet, each one is an individual pathway to the experience
      and not a sequential step. In this book, references of non-English words
      have been explained as footnotes on the first three occurrences of the
      word, and explained in the glossary as well.
    </p>

      others who experience a similar need, visit
      <a href="https://kailaasa.org">https://kailaasa.org</a>. You can also join
      one of the many hundred Worldwide Spiritual Embassies around the world and
      interact with others who are already on this path.
    </p>

    <p>
      This book is an amazing journey into Existential Truths and a gift from an
      enlightened master of this millennium.

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>
      If you are here, it means Existence wants you to be here in this form. You
      are not an accident, you are an incident. You are a conscious miracle of
      Existence. Don't think this is positive thinking. This is the
      straightforward and simple Truth. If you trust this Truth, you will start
      experiencing life in its pinnacle.
    </p>

    <p>
      Understand, Existence is trying to express itself through you. What you
      call your potential is nothing but the expression of Existence through
      you. When you freely allow this, you will start realizing your infinite
      potential. When you start becoming the fulfillment of Existence, you
      become flowing energy, which is what I call Living Enlightenment. Living
      Enlightenment is living with the flowing energy of Existence, in
      synchronicity with its miraculous happenings.
    </p>

    <p>
      When you live this way, you will find there is no personal barrier, no
      emotional baggage, nothing that holds you back in life. Life flows
      continuously like a river, carrying bliss and fulfillment every moment.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this book, you will find deeper truths and powerful techniques to tide
      over personal barriers and resolve emotional conflicts. You will also find
      truths that demystify your relevance in this vast cosmos, so you start
      moving in a higher plane of consciousness.
    </p>

    <p>
      This book is for anyone who wishes to live a fulfilling life. It reveals
      the secrets of the self, Existence and the world. It is for every
      individual to start experiencing the ultimate purpose of taking human
      birth on planet earth. It is meant to give the experience of:
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Shakti</em>, the Energy to understand and change whatever you need to
      change in life
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Buddhi</em>, the Intelligence to understand and accept whatever you
      don't need to change in life
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Yukti</em>, the Clarity to understand and realize that however much
      you change, whatever you see as reality is itself a continuously changing
      dream
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Bhakti</em>, the Devotion, the feeling of deep connection to That
      which is unchanging, Eternal and Ultimate, and
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Mukti</em>, the ultimate Liberation into Living Enlightenment when all
      these four are integrated.

    <h2>Flow in Love</h2>

    <p>
      Psychology explains that thoughts arise in the brain, and emotions from
      the heart. Irrespective of where they arise from, thoughts and emotions
      are inseparable. Ancient scriptures say that thoughts create us. So do
      emotions. We become what our emotions are. Managing our emotions is
      crucial to transforming our lives.
    </p>

    <h3>What is Love?</h3>

    <p>
      Whenever we look at something, the first thing we do is to calculate what
      we can get from it. It can be a person or an object, that doesn't matter.
      Our thoughts start functioning either through fear or through greed to
      calculate what there is in the situation for us. Our attention is centered
      on that object or person.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is possible to turn our attention towards our own inner space and ask,
      'What can I contribute?', 'What can I add?', 'How can I enrich others?' If
      the process is only to ask, 'What can I get out of it?' then it is driven
      by lust. If the process asks, 'How can I enrich it?' it is driven by love!
      Lust is an energy that demands. Love is an energy that gives.
    </p>

    <p>
      To tell you honestly, it is very difficult to define love exactly. Mere
      words cannot express it precisely. I am trying to use a few words here and
      there so that some word will click within you.
    </p>

    <p>
      Love is an intense experience in one's inner space. Many of us think love
      is a choice. We think experience and expression of love are a choice. We
      think that if we want to, we can handle love; otherwise we can let it go.
      No! It is not a choice as we think. It is a basic necessity of life.
    </p>

    <p>
      When I say life, I don't mean just breathing and staying alive. I mean
      being alive at the innermost being level, as a live Consciousness. If you
      can express love, if you can experience love, that is the only way of
      being alive as a Consciousness. If you don't experience and express love,
      you may inhale and exhale, but you can't say you are a live being. There
      are so many animals, plants and other things that breathe day in and day
      out. You will continue to exist like them, that's all.
    </p>

    <p>A small story:</p>

    <p class="p-story">
      A disciple asked a Zen<sup id="what-is-love-ref1"><a href="#what-is-love-1">1</a></sup> master,
      'Does an enlightened master speak?'
    </p>

    <p class="p-story">
      The master said, 'No, an enlightened person never speaks. Only a person
      who doesn't know enlightenment speaks.'
    </p>

    <p class="p-story">
      Then the disciple asked, 'So does an enlightened master keep quiet?'
    </p>

    <p class="p-story">
      The master said, 'No, an enlightened master never keeps quiet. If he keeps
      quiet, then he is not enlightened.'
    </p>

    <p class="p-story">
      The disciple was puzzled. He asked, 'You say he neither speaks nor keeps
      quiet. What does he do?'
    </p>

    <p class="p-story">
      The master replied, 'He sings! His being sings. He neither speaks, nor
      keeps quiet. His very being sings.'
    </p>

    <p>
      Love is the ultimate experience of a human being. When the experience
      happens, we will not be able to possess the experience, only the
      experience will possess us! That is what the master means. When the
      experience possesses us, whatever we do will be like a beautiful song. Any
      word that comes out will be poetry. Our being will be so light. We will
      simply float. Our walking will be a dance. Our body language will radiate
      grace. All our expressions will be of great service to humanity.
    </p>

    <p>
      All human beings are born as loving beings. A newborn baby radiates
      causeless love. Does she know anyone around her at birth? No! Her energy
      is causeless love. As we grow, society instills fear and greed in us and
      we orient our love based on greed and fear. Then it is no longer causeless
      love. It is love with a reason. It becomes suffocating. We start feeling
      other emotions like jealousy, fear and anger. We experience only love with
      a cause, a reason. But with a little awareness and awakening, it is
      possible to reclaim our original love.
