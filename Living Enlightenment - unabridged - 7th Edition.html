    <p>
      Living enlightenment is actualizing the limitless potential and
      experiencing the ultimate as every moment of life unfolds afresh.
    </p>

    <p>
      Living in this divine space is living the best life and doing the greatest
      service to society.
    </p>

    <h2>Contents</h2>

    <h2>Preface</h2>

    <p>
      Many reputed intellectuals including scientists have recorded that there
      has been an elevation in human consciousness in recent times. Whether it
      is to do with the Age of Aquarius as rock groups foresaw or the
      metaphorical end of the world as the Mayans predicted is not the question
      here.
    </p>

    <p>
      The question is, how do we define consciousness? As societal beings who
      have been guided all our lives by moral and legal commandments, our beacon
      of behavior has always been conscience. But conscience is not
      consciousness.
    </p>

    <p>
      Consciousness is the awareness that there is something more to our life
      than the material pleasures that we seek. Consciousness is that tension
      within us that tells us there is something higher than what we see. It is
      the beacon of inner awareness that guides us to a state of being where we
      realize that we are more than what we think we are.
    </p>

    <p>
      Human beings are far more than mere bio machines. This is why even the
      most powerful computer would never be able to replace the human. It can
      replace the mind and the body but not the energy of the human being. It
      might be a fact that we ascended from animals. But it is the truth that we
      can go further.
    </p>

    <p>
      From time immemorial wise men of all cultures have pondered deep into this
      simple yet intangible issue of what lies within us. 'Who am I' has been
      the refrain of many sages. Many did find the answer. Their answers were
      experiential. The scriptures of all great religions are the expressions of
      these wise masters to convey their experience to us. When they live, the
      masters themselves are the experience that we can share.
    </p>

    <p>Paramahamsa Nithyananda is such an experience.</p>

    <p>
      This book is the first volume of the essence of the wisdom of Nithyananda
      that has so far been expressed. Nithyananda has spoken in a number of
      structured programs. He has commented on great scriptures like the
      Bhagavad Gita and spoken to large public and small private groups over the
      last five years. This book is an essence of these teachings.
    </p>

    <p>
      This book takes you through an understanding of why we behave the way we
      do and explains how we can change the way we act so that we are in
      synchronicity with the energy of the cosmos. Meditation techniques
      provided in this book help you to experience this synchronicity.
    </p>

    <p>
      The understanding and the experience that we are one with the energy
      outside us expands our consciousness. We realize that we are one with
      every other individual, however different the individual may be in
      culture, color, language, religion or tribe. We realize that we are all
      waves in the same cosmic ocean.
    </p>

    <p>
      This experience is Living Enlightenment. This experience is Nithyananda.
    </p>

    <p>
      While there is some order in the way the chapters are structured, you may
      move back and forth in any order to read the subject of your choice. All
      chapters are interconnected with the common thread of Living
      Enlightenment. Yet, each one is an individual pathway to the experience
      and not a sequential step. In this book, references of non-English words
      have been explained as footnotes on the first three occurrences of the
      word, and explained in the glossary as well.
    </p>

      As you go deeper into the experience and feel the need to interact with
      others who experience a similar need, visit
      <a href="https://kailaasa.org">https://kailaasa.org</a>. You can also join
      one of the many hundred Worldwide Spiritual Embassies around the world and
      interact with others who are already on this path.
    </p>

    <p>
      This book is an amazing journey into Existential Truths and a gift from an
      enlightened master of this millennium.

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>
      If you are here, it means Existence wants you to be here in this form. You
      are not an accident, you are an incident. You are a conscious miracle of
      Existence. Don't think this is positive thinking. This is the
      straightforward and simple Truth. If you trust this Truth, you will start
      experiencing life in its pinnacle.
    </p>

    <p>
      Understand, Existence is trying to express itself through you. What you
      call your potential is nothing but the expression of Existence through
      you. When you freely allow this, you will start realizing your infinite
      potential. When you start becoming the fulfillment of Existence, you
      become flowing energy, which is what I call Living Enlightenment. Living
      Enlightenment is living with the flowing energy of Existence, in
      synchronicity with its miraculous happenings.
    </p>

    <p>
      When you live this way, you will find there is no personal barrier, no
      emotional baggage, nothing that holds you back in life. Life flows
      continuously like a river, carrying bliss and fulfillment every moment.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this book, you will find deeper truths and powerful techniques to tide
      over personal barriers and resolve emotional conflicts. You will also find
      truths that demystify your relevance in this vast cosmos, so you start
      moving in a higher plane of consciousness.
    </p>

    <p>
      This book is for anyone who wishes to live a fulfilling life. It reveals
      the secrets of the self, Existence and the world. It is for every
      individual to start experiencing the ultimate purpose of taking human
      birth on planet earth. It is meant to give the experience of:
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Shakti</em>, the Energy to understand and change whatever you need to
      change in life
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Buddhi</em>, the Intelligence to understand and accept whatever you
      don't need to change in life
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Yukti</em>, the Clarity to understand and realize that however much
      you change, whatever you see as reality is itself a continuously changing
      dream
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Bhakti</em>, the Devotion, the feeling of deep connection to That
      which is unchanging, Eternal and Ultimate, and
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Mukti</em>, the ultimate Liberation into Living Enlightenment when all
      these four are integrated.

    <h2>Flow in Love</h2>

    <p>
      Psychology explains that thoughts arise in the brain, and emotions from
      the heart. Irrespective of where they arise from, thoughts and emotions
      are inseparable. Ancient scriptures say that thoughts create us. So do
      emotions. We become what our emotions are. Managing our emotions is
      crucial to transforming our lives.
    </p>

    <h3>What is Love?</h3>

    <p>
      Whenever we look at something, the first thing we do is to calculate what
      we can get from it. It can be a person or an object, that doesn't matter.
      Our thoughts start functioning either through fear or through greed to
      calculate what there is in the situation for us. Our attention is centered
      on that object or person.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is possible to turn our attention towards our own inner space and ask,
      'What can I contribute?', 'What can I add?', 'How can I enrich others?' If
      the process is only to ask, 'What can I get out of it?' then it is driven
      by lust. If the process asks, 'How can I enrich it?' it is driven by love!
      Lust is an energy that demands. Love is an energy that gives.
    </p>

    <p>
      To tell you honestly, it is very difficult to define love exactly. Mere
      words cannot express it precisely. I am trying to use a few words here and
      there so that some word will click within you.
    </p>

    <p>
      Love is an intense experience in one's inner space. Many of us think love
      is a choice. We think experience and expression of love are a choice. We
      think that if we want to, we can handle love; otherwise we can let it go.
      No! It is not a choice as we think. It is a basic necessity of life.
    </p>

    <p>
      When I say life, I don't mean just breathing and staying alive. I mean
      being alive at the innermost being level, as a live Consciousness. If you
      can express love, if you can experience love, that is the only way of
      being alive as a Consciousness. If you don't experience and express love,
      you may inhale and exhale, but you can't say you are a live being. There
      are so many animals, plants and other things that breathe day in and day
      out. You will continue to exist like them, that's all.
    </p>

    <p>A small story:</p>

    <p class="p-story">
      A disciple asked a Zen<sup id="what-is-love-ref1"
        ><a href="#what-is-love-1">1</a></sup
      >
      master, 'Does an enlightened master speak?'
    </p>

    <p class="p-story">
      The master said, 'No, an enlightened person never speaks. Only a person
      who doesn't know enlightenment speaks.'
    </p>

    <p class="p-story">
      Then the disciple asked, 'So does an enlightened master keep quiet?'
    </p>

    <p class="p-story">
      The master said, 'No, an enlightened master never keeps quiet. If he keeps
      quiet, then he is not enlightened.'
    </p>

    <p class="p-story">
      The disciple was puzzled. He asked, 'You say he neither speaks nor keeps
      quiet. What does he do?'
    </p>

    <p class="p-story">
      The master replied, 'He sings! His being sings. He neither speaks, nor
      keeps quiet. His very being sings.'
    </p>

    <p>
      Love is the ultimate experience of a human being. When the experience
      happens, we will not be able to possess the experience, only the
      experience will possess us! That is what the master means. When the
      experience possesses us, whatever we do will be like a beautiful song. Any
      word that comes out will be poetry. Our being will be so light. We will
      simply float. Our walking will be a dance. Our body language will radiate
      grace. All our expressions will be of great service to humanity.
    </p>

    <p>
      All human beings are born as loving beings. A newborn baby radiates
      causeless love. Does she know anyone around her at birth? No! Her energy
      is causeless love. As we grow, society instills fear and greed in us and
      we orient our love based on greed and fear. Then it is no longer causeless
      love. It is love with a reason. It becomes suffocating. We start feeling
      other emotions like jealousy, fear and anger. We experience only love with
      a cause, a reason. But with a little awareness and awakening, it is
      possible to reclaim our original love.

    <h3>Love cannot be created</h3>

    <p>
      Love can never be made to happen with just our logical decision. Our
      mental setup itself should be created in such a way that we become love
      and our actions speak love. Our logic should start radiating a love that
      is beyond logic! When real love happens in us, we will not even be aware
      that we are loving. Only others will be aware that we are radiating love.
    </p>

    <p>
      When real love happens, we overflow with so much energy that we will have
      the courage to share whatever we have with others. We get tremendous
      confidence because we know it has happened in us! Whether it is energy,
      time, talent or pleasure, only when we are overflowing can we really share
      it. Similarly, love happens only naturally, never through compulsion. If
      we try to create love, it will be like forcing open the petals of a flower
      to make it bloom. Can it be called flowering? No. Love is a flower that
      blossoms deep within your being and sends out a sweet fragrance that we
      share with others.
    </p>

    <h3>Love heals five types of restlessness</h3>

    <p>
      The word 'love' is loaded with so many different meanings, interpretations
      and commentaries. First, let us leave out the idea of selfless and
      spiritual love. Let us first consider the normal, simple love with all its
      possessiveness, jealousy and all the side effects it causes! Even that
      love can do a lot of good for the body and mind. Later we will discuss
      selfless, spiritual love or mature love.
    </p>

    <p>
      The other day I was reading an article in a magazine. The title was, 'Live
      Forever'. I was amazed to read it. It gave eleven techniques to extend
      your life by at least twenty years and it was supported by statistics and
      survey reports. All the eleven techniques were related to love. It said
      that even caring for a pet animal releases a hormone in us that allows us
      to live at ease with our body. If caring for our pet animals does so much,
      surely caring for the husband or for the wife will do a lot more!
    </p>

    <p>
      The article also spoke of how people die early if they are single or
      widowers and how life is extended with love. It also spoke of how chances
      of getting cancer or depression are less when you have love in your life.
      Even what we call ordinary love, simple infatuation, can do miracles for
      our body and mind. It can give us a deep feeling of healing and wellbeing.
    </p>

    <p>
      According to Tantra<sup id="love-heals-five-types-of-restlessness-ref1"
        ><a href="#love-heals-five-types-of-restlessness-1">1</a></sup
      >, five types of restlessness happen in a person and all of these can be
      healed by ordinary love, by the simple caring for one another. Once again,
      I am not speaking of spiritual love or devotion or selfless love. That
      comes later.
    </p>

    <p>A small story:</p>

    <p class="p-story">
      A school boy fell in love with a girl from his own grade.
    </p>

    <p class="p-story">
      One day he was kidnapped by an extremist group and sent to a camp across
      the border for training. A few months later he came back to his homeland
      to spread terror.
    </p>

    <p class="p-story">
      He entered his village to find that the family of his beloved was killed
      by terrorists.
    </p>

    <p class="p-story">
      He met the girl and they started talking. She told him how much she hated
      what was happening and begged him to stop what he was doing. She told him
      she would marry him only if he surrendered to the authorities.
    </p>

    <p class="p-story">
      The boy immediately surrendered and joined the army fighting the
      insurgency while carrying a photograph of the girl in his pocket all the
      time.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let us first talk of simple, practical love that you share with someone
      for some reason, either because the person will support you socially or
      support you when you face some difficulty or just because you want to
      maintain a good relationship with that person. For any of these reasons
      you may show love. Even this type of love heals you from the following
      five kinds of restlessness.
    </p>

    <p>
      The first kind of restlessness happens due to your circumstances.
      Sometimes, in a particular place or situation you feel restless. If you
      move from that place or situation, you feel more settled. Even under
      uncomfortable circumstances, if you just show a gesture of love to
      someone, or if someone shows a gesture of love to you, things can become
      instantly better for you! It can heal you.
    </p>

    <p>
      The second kind of restlessness is physical. Physical restlessness is
      nothing but a constant tension in your body for no particular reason. It
      is said that all such tension can be released when you express love to
      somebody. You may ask,'How can love take away physical restlessness?' You
      can see for example, a mother who has a child to look after will feel
      continuously rejuvenated in spite of the child driving her crazy! Because
      of the love element, she will cope with the tension. Otherwise, taking
      care of children is not an easy job!
    </p>

    <p>
      The rejuvenation happens because of the love and care the mother feels for
      the child. Any tension or restlessness in the body disappears when you
      care for somebody, when you smile at somebody, when you express love in
      your body language, even if it is just once.
    </p>

    <p>
      When you express yourself through your head, it is called intelligence.
      When you express yourself through your heart, it is felt as love. When you
      express yourself through your being, it is experienced as energy. When you
      relax into your being without expressing, it is bliss! Each one is the
      same energy but expressed in four different ways.
    </p>

    <p>
      So whenever you express love, you express energy also. Love is
      concentrated, caring energy. So naturally, whenever you express love you
      become a channel for healing energy. When you are a channel for energy,
      you not only heal others but heal yourself as well.
    </p>

    <p>
      The third form of restlessness is mental. Any mental restlessness can be
      healed by love. Research indicates that when you care for pets or play
      with children, you reduce the possibility of heart attacks and also reduce
      the risk of fatal diseases!
    </p>

    <p>
      The fourth form of restlessness is emotional. Mental restlessness is
      different from emotional restlessness. Mental restlessness is purely
      intellectual and can be controlled easily. But emotional restlessness
      cannot be controlled by just a few words of consolation. It can be healed
      only when you express love. When you start radiating love, it floods your
      being with energy. When your being is opened to such higher energies, it
      heals the emotional restlessness.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ultimately, we come to spiritual restlessness. There are so many people
      who can sit with others, who can sit with the television, who can sit with
      newspapers, but who can't sit with themselves. This is what is called
      spiritual restlessness. Spiritual restlessness means that you cannot sit
      with yourself. You can give appointments to everybody else but not to
      yourself!
    </p>

    <p>
      Your love for the teacher or the master can heal your spiritual
      restlessness. Many people come and tell me, 'Swamiji, just sitting in your
      presence puts us in a calm state but when we go back home, we are not able
      to remain in that calmness. Why is it so?'' When you are in the presence
      of an enlightened person, you start relating, you start expressing your
      love towards him automatically. This heals your spiritual restlessness.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you observe when I speak, I often give long gaps between words. The
      gaps are actually used to bring down your spiritual restlessness. When you
      sit in front of the television, you are able to sit so comfortably because
      information is just pushed into your being without a break. You aren't
      given a chance to experience your restlessness. So while your restlessness
      is actually supported and increased, you don't experience it and you feel
      very comfortable.
    </p>

    <p>
      But here, if you have the patience to sit and listen to these words with
      the gaps, your spiritual restlessness will come down and the tendency of
      your mind to ask for the next thought will also come down. You
      automatically become receptive and these words will not only touch your
      head, but they will directly touch your heart as well. If you are totally
      relaxed and at ease with yourself without too many thoughts, your being
      will open, taking in everything and be healed.
    </p>

    <p>
      If your mind is calm, just listening is enough. There is no need to even
      meditate separately later. The very listening itself can create the
      experience in you. If your listening is not proper, then it is difficult
      for the experience to happen. J. Krishnamurti<sup
        id="love-heals-five-types-of-restlessness-ref2"
        ><a href="#love-heals-five-types-of-restlessness-2">2</a></sup
      >, the famous philosopher says, 'Listening is god.' Deep and total
      listening without restlessness is divine. That itself is god. If you look
      deeply into your being, the very presence of the master that causes love
      to happen in you heals the spiritual restlessness.

    <h3>Love brings great courage</h3>

    <p>
      A beautiful incident happened in the life of Ramanuja<sup
        id="love-brings-great-courage-ref1"
        ><a href="#love-brings-great-courage-1">1</a></sup
      >. If you study the life of Ramanuja, you will see how he used every step
      of his life to move towards enlightenment.
    </p>

    <p class="p-story">
      When his teacher initiated Ramanuja, he gave him a special chant. The
      teacher told him not to pass on the chant to anybody and that if he did
      so, he would go to hell. Ramanuja asked him what would happen to the
      others with whom he might share it. The teacher said that they would be
      led to salvation.
    </p>

    <p class="p-story">
      What would we have done? Naturally we would have kept quiet, thinking,
      'Why unnecessarily go to hell?'
    </p>

    <p class="p-story">
      Ramanuja immediately stood on a platform in a temple and called out to the
      whole village. He loudly pronounced the chant given by his teacher and
      told the people, 'Let you all go to heaven! I am not bothered about me
      going to hell. Let you all reach heaven!'

      When you are deeply in love, you feel as if your whole being is open and
      you are ready to go to any extreme for the sake of anybody. You are ready
      to go to any boundary, as there is nothing to protect within your being.
      Your being is totally open. You don't feel insecure when you are wild with
      love. That is why people who are in love always do risky things. They take
      the risk because they feel they have nothing to lose. There is no
      insecurity about anything. They feel so expansive. Love gives tremendous
      courage and energy. It opens you up. It makes you finally available to
      yourself. As of now, you are not available to yourself. Love can make you
      available to yourself.

      When the teacher saw what Ramanuja did, he admitted that he learned a
      lesson from his disciple and declared that Ramanuja had reached greater
      heights than him. He told Ramanuja, 'You are in a different space now.'
