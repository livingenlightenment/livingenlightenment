# Love cannpot be created

Love can never be made to happen with
just our logical decision. Our mental setup
itself should be created in such a way that
we become love and our actions speak
love. Our logic should start radiating a love
that is beyond logic! When real love
happens in us, we will not even be aware
that we are loving. Only others will be
aware that we are radiating love.

When real love happens, we overflow with
so much energy that we will have the
courage to share whatever we have with
others. We get tremendous confidence
because we know it has happened in us!
Whether it is energy, time, talent or
pleasure, only when we are overflowing
can we really share it. Similarly, love
happens only naturally, never through
compulsion. If we try to create love, it will
be like forcing open the petals of a flower
to make it bloom. Can it be called
flowering? No. Love is a flower that
blossoms deep within your being and sends
out a sweet fragrance that we share with
others.
