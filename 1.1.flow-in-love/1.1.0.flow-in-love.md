Psychology explains that thoughts arise in
the brain, and emotions from the heart.
Irrespective of where they arise from,
thoughts and emotions are inseparable.
Ancient scriptures say that thoughts create
us. So do emotions. We become what our
emotions are. Managing our emotions is
crucial to transforming our lives.
