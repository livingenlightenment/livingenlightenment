      <h2>Preface</h2>

      <p>
        Many reputed intellectuals including scientists have recorded that there
        has been an elevation in human consciousness in recent times. Whether it
        is to do with the Age of Aquarius as rock groups foresaw or the
        metaphorical end of the world as the Mayans predicted is not the
        question here.
      </p>

      <p>
        The question is, how do we define consciousness? As societal beings who
        have been guided all our lives by moral and legal commandments, our
        beacon of behavior has always been conscience. But conscience is not
        consciousness.
      </p>

      <p>
        Consciousness is the awareness that there is something more to our life
        than the material pleasures that we seek. Consciousness is that tension
        within us that tells us there is something higher than what we see. It
        is the beacon of inner awareness that guides us to a state of being
        where we realize that we are more than what we think we are.
      </p>

      <p>
        Human beings are far more than mere bio machines. This is why even the
        most powerful computer would never be able to replace the human. It can
        replace the mind and the body but not the energy of the human being. It
        might be a fact that we ascended from animals. But it is the truth that
        we can go further.
      </p>

      <p>
        From time immemorial wise men of all cultures have pondered deep into
        this simple yet intangible issue of what lies within us. &ldquo;Who am
        I&rdquo; has been the refrain of many sages. Many did find the answer.
        Their answers were experiential. The scriptures of all great religions
        are the expressions of these wise masters to convey their experience to
        us. When they live, the masters themselves are the experience that we
        can share.
      </p>

      <p>Paramahamsa Nithyananda is such an experience.</p>

      <p>
        This book is the first volume of the essence of the wisdom of
        Nithyananda that has so far been expressed. Nithyananda has spoken in a
        number of structured programs. He has commented on great scriptures like
        the Bhagavad Gita and spoken to large public and small private groups
        over the last five years. This book is an essence of these teachings.
      </p>

      <p>
        This book takes you through an understanding of why we behave the way we
        do and explains how we can change the way we act so that we are in
        synchronicity with the energy of the cosmos. Meditation techniques
        provided in this book help you to experience this synchronicity.
      </p>

      <p>
        The understanding and the experience that we are one with the energy
        outside us expands our consciousness. We realize that we are one with
        every other individual, however different the individual may be in
        culture, color, language, religion or tribe. We realize that we are all
        waves in the same cosmic ocean.
      </p>

      <p>
        This experience is Living Enlightenment. This experience is Nithyananda.
      </p>

      <p>
        While there is some order in the way the chapters are structured, you
        may move back and forth in any order to read the subject of your choice.
        All chapters are interconnected with the common thread of Living
        Enlightenment. Yet, each one is an individual pathway to the experience
        and not a sequential step. In this book, references of non-English words
        have been explained as footnotes on the first three occurrences of the
        word, and explained in the glossary as well.
      </p>

      <p>
        As you go deeper into the experience and feel the need to interact with
        others who experience a similar need, visit
        <a href="https://kailaasa.org">https://kailaasa.org</a>. You can also
        join one of the many hundred Worldwide Spiritual Embassies around the
        world and interact with others who are already on this path.
      </p>

      <p>
        This book is an amazing journey into Existential Truths and a gift from
        an enlightened master of this millennium.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>
        If you are here, it means Existence wants you to be here in this form.
        You are not an accident, you are an incident. You are a conscious
        miracle of Existence. Don't think this is positive thinking. This is the
        straightforward and simple Truth. If you trust this Truth, you will
        start experiencing life in its pinnacle.
      </p>

      <p>
        Understand, Existence is trying to express itself through you. What you
        call your potential is nothing but the expression of Existence through
        you. When you freely allow this, you will start realizing your infinite
        potential. When you start becoming the fulfillment of Existence, you
        become flowing energy, which is what I call Living Enlightenment. Living
        Enlightenment is living with the flowing energy of Existence, in
        synchronicity with its miraculous happenings.
      </p>

      <p>
        When you live this way, you will find there is no personal barrier, no
        emotional baggage, nothing that holds you back in life. Life flows
        continuously like a river, carrying bliss and fulfillment every moment.
      </p>

      <p>
        In this book, you will find deeper truths and powerful techniques to
        tide over personal barriers and resolve emotional conflicts. You will
        also find truths that demystify your relevance in this vast cosmos, so
        you start moving in a higher plane of consciousness.
      </p>

      <p>
        This book is for anyone who wishes to live a fulfilling life. It reveals
        the secrets of the self, Existence and the world. It is for every
        individual to start experiencing the ultimate purpose of taking human
        birth on planet earth. It is meant to give the experience of:
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Shakti</em>, the Energy to understand and change whatever you need
        to change in life
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Buddhi</em>, the Intelligence to understand and accept whatever you
        don&rsquo;t need to change in life
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Yukti</em>, the Clarity to understand and realize that however much
        you change, whatever you see as reality is itself a continuously
        changing dream
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Bhakti</em>, the Devotion, the feeling of deep connection to That
        which is unchanging, Eternal and Ultimate, and
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Mukti</em>, the ultimate Liberation into Living Enlightenment when
        all these four are integrated.

      <h2>Flow in Love</h2>

      <p>
        Psychology explains that thoughts arise in the brain, and emotions from
        the heart. Irrespective of where they arise from, thoughts and emotions
        are inseparable. Ancient scriptures say that thoughts create us. So do
        emotions. We become what our emotions are. Managing our emotions is
        crucial to transforming our lives.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="what-is-love" class="chapter-container">
      <h3>What is Love?</h3>

      <p>
        Whenever we look at something, the first thing we do is to calculate
        what we can get from it. It can be a person or an object, that
        doesn&rsquo;t matter. Our thoughts start functioning either through fear
        or through greed to calculate what there is in the situation for us. Our
        attention is centered on that object or person.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is possible to turn our attention towards our own inner space and
        ask, &ldquo;What can I contribute?&rdquo;, &ldquo;What can I
        add?&rdquo;, &ldquo;How can I enrich others?&rdquo; If the process is
        only to ask, &ldquo;What can I get out of it?&rdquo; then it is driven
        by lust. If the process asks, &ldquo;How can I enrich it?&rdquo; it is
        driven by love! Lust is an energy that demands. Love is an energy that
        gives.
      </p>

      <p>
        To tell you honestly, it is very difficult to define love exactly. Mere
        words cannot express it precisely. I am trying to use a few words here
        and there so that some word will click within you.
      </p>

      <p>
        Love is an intense experience in one&rsquo;s inner space. Many of us
        think love is a choice. We think experience and expression of love are a
        choice. We think that if we want to, we can handle love; otherwise we
        can let it go. No! It is not a choice as we think. It is a basic
        necessity of life.
      </p>

      <p>
        When I say life, I don&rsquo;t mean just breathing and staying alive. I
        mean being alive at the innermost being level, as a live Consciousness.
        If you can express love, if you can experience love, that is the only
        way of being alive as a Consciousness. If you don&rsquo;t experience and
        express love, you may inhale and exhale, but you can&rsquo;t say you are
        a live being. There are so many animals, plants and other things that
        breathe day in and day out. You will continue to exist like them,
        that&rsquo;s all.
      </p>

      <p>A small story:</p>

      <p class="p-story">
        A disciple asked a Zen<sup id="what-is-love-ref1"
          ><a href="#what-is-love-1">1</a></sup
        >
        master, &ldquo;Does an enlightened master speak?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p class="p-story">
        The master said, &ldquo;No, an enlightened person never speaks. Only a
        person who doesn&rsquo;t know enlightenment speaks.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p class="p-story">
        Then the disciple asked, &ldquo;So does an enlightened master keep
        quiet?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p class="p-story">
        The master said, &ldquo;No, an enlightened master never keeps quiet. If
        he keeps quiet, then he is not enlightened.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p class="p-story">
        The disciple was puzzled. He asked, &ldquo;You say he neither speaks nor
        keeps quiet. What does he do?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p class="p-story">
        The master replied, &ldquo;He sings! His being sings. He neither speaks,
        nor keeps quiet. His very being sings.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Love is the ultimate experience of a human being. When the experience
        happens, we will not be able to possess the experience, only the
        experience will possess us! That is what the master means. When the
        experience possesses us, whatever we do will be like a beautiful song.
        Any word that comes out will be poetry. Our being will be so light. We
        will simply float. Our walking will be a dance. Our body language will
        radiate grace. All our expressions will be of great service to humanity.
      </p>

      <p>
        All human beings are born as loving beings. A newborn baby radiates
        causeless love. Does she know anyone around her at birth? No! Her energy
        is causeless love. As we grow, society instills fear and greed in us and
        we orient our love based on greed and fear. Then it is no longer
        causeless love. It is love with a reason. It becomes suffocating. We
        start feeling other emotions like jealousy, fear and anger. We
        experience only love with a cause, a reason. But with a little awareness
        and awakening, it is possible to reclaim our original love.

        Love can never be made to happen with just our logical decision. Our

        and our actions speak love. Our logic should start radiating a love that
        is beyond logic! When real love happens in us, we will not even be aware
        that we are loving. Only others will be aware that we are radiating
        love.
      </p>

      <p>
        When real love happens, we overflow with so much energy that we will
        have the courage to share whatever we have with others. We get
        tremendous confidence because we know it has happened in us! Whether it
        is energy, time, talent or pleasure, only when we are overflowing can we
        really share it. Similarly, love happens only naturally, never through
        compulsion. If we try to create love, it will be like forcing open the
        petals of a flower to make it bloom. Can it be called flowering? No.
        Love is a flower that blossoms deep within your being and sends out a
        sweet fragrance that we share with others.

      <h3>Love heals five types of restlessness</h3>

      <p>
        The word &ldquo;love&rdquo; is loaded with so many different meanings,
        interpretations and commentaries. First, let us leave out the idea of
        selfless and spiritual love. Let us first consider the normal, simple
        love with all its possessiveness, jealousy and all the side effects it
        causes! Even that love can do a lot of good for the body and mind. Later
        we will discuss selfless, spiritual love or mature love.
      </p>

      <p>
        The other day I was reading an article in a magazine. The title was,
        &ldquo;Live Forever&rdquo;. I was amazed to read it. It gave eleven
        techniques to extend your life by at least twenty years and it was
        supported by statistics and survey reports. All the eleven techniques
        were related to love. It said that even caring for a pet animal releases
        a hormone in us that allows us to live at ease with our body. If caring
        for our pet animals does so much, surely caring for the husband or for
        the wife will do a lot more!
      </p>

      <p>
        The article also spoke of how people die early if they are single or
        widowers and how life is extended with love. It also spoke of how
        chances of getting cancer or depression are less when you have love in
        your life. Even what we call ordinary love, simple infatuation, can do
        miracles for our body and mind. It can give us a deep feeling of healing
        and wellbeing.
      </p>

      <p>
        According to Tantra<sup id="love-heals-five-types-of-restlessness-ref1"
          ><a href="#love-heals-five-types-of-restlessness-1">1</a></sup
        >, five types of restlessness happen in a person and all of these can be
        healed by ordinary love, by the simple caring for one another. Once
        again, I am not speaking of spiritual love or devotion or selfless love.
        That comes later.
      </p>

      <p>A small story:</p>

      <p class="p-story">
        A school boy fell in love with a girl from his own grade.
      </p>

      <p class="p-story">
        One day he was kidnapped by an extremist group and sent to a camp across
        the border for training. A few months later he came back to his homeland
        to spread terror.
      </p>

      <p class="p-story">
        He entered his village to find that the family of his beloved was killed
        by terrorists.
      </p>

      <p class="p-story">
        He met the girl and they started talking. She told him how much she
        hated what was happening and begged him to stop what he was doing. She
        told him she would marry him only if he surrendered to the authorities.
      </p>

      <p class="p-story">
        The boy immediately surrendered and joined the army fighting the
        insurgency while carrying a photograph of the girl in his pocket all the
        time.
      </p>

      <p>
        Let us first talk of simple, practical love that you share with someone
        for some reason, either because the person will support you socially or
        support you when you face some difficulty or just because you want to
        maintain a good relationship with that person. For any of these reasons
        you may show love. Even this type of love heals you from the following
        five kinds of restlessness.
      </p>

      <p>
        The first kind of restlessness happens due to your circumstances.
        Sometimes, in a particular place or situation you feel restless. If you
        move from that place or situation, you feel more settled. Even under
        uncomfortable circumstances, if you just show a gesture of love to
        someone, or if someone shows a gesture of love to you, things can become
        instantly better for you! It can heal you.
      </p>

      <p>
        The second kind of restlessness is physical. Physical restlessness is
        nothing but a constant tension in your body for no particular reason. It
        is said that all such tension can be released when you express love to
        somebody. You may ask,&ldquo;How can love take away physical
        restlessness?&rdquo; You can see for example, a mother who has a child
        to look after will feel continuously rejuvenated in spite of the child
        driving her crazy! Because of the love element, she will cope with the
        tension. Otherwise, taking care of children is not an easy job!
      </p>

      <p>
        The rejuvenation happens because of the love and care the mother feels
        for the child. Any tension or restlessness in the body disappears when
        you care for somebody, when you smile at somebody, when you express love
        in your body language, even if it is just once.
      </p>

      <p>
        When you express yourself through your head, it is called intelligence.
        When you express yourself through your heart, it is felt as love. When
        you express yourself through your being, it is experienced as energy.
        When you relax into your being without expressing, it is bliss! Each one
        is the same energy but expressed in four different ways.
      </p>

      <p>
        So whenever you express love, you express energy also. Love is
        concentrated, caring energy. So naturally, whenever you express love you
        become a channel for healing energy. When you are a channel for energy,
        you not only heal others but heal yourself as well.
      </p>

      <p>
        The third form of restlessness is mental. Any mental restlessness can be
        healed by love. Research indicates that when you care for pets or play
        with children, you reduce the possibility of heart attacks and also
        reduce the risk of fatal diseases!
      </p>

      <p>
        The fourth form of restlessness is emotional. Mental restlessness is
        different from emotional restlessness. Mental restlessness is purely
        intellectual and can be controlled easily. But emotional restlessness
        cannot be controlled by just a few words of consolation. It can be
        healed only when you express love. When you start radiating love, it
        floods your being with energy. When your being is opened to such higher
        energies, it heals the emotional restlessness.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ultimately, we come to spiritual restlessness. There are so many people
        who can sit with others, who can sit with the television, who can sit
        with newspapers, but who can&rsquo;t sit with themselves. This is what
        is called spiritual restlessness. Spiritual restlessness means that you
        cannot sit with yourself. You can give appointments to everybody else
        but not to yourself!
      </p>

      <p>
        Your love for the teacher or the master can heal your spiritual
        restlessness. Many people come and tell me, &ldquo;Swamiji, just sitting
        in your presence puts us in a calm state but when we go back home, we
        are not able to remain in that calmness. Why is it so?&rdquo; When you
        are in the presence of an enlightened person, you start relating, you
        start expressing your love towards him automatically. This heals your
        spiritual restlessness.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you observe when I speak, I often give long gaps between words. The
        gaps are actually used to bring down your spiritual restlessness. When
        you sit in front of the television, you are able to sit so comfortably
        because information is just pushed into your being without a break. You
        aren&rsquo;t given a chance to experience your restlessness. So while
        your restlessness is actually supported and increased, you don&rsquo;t
        experience it and you feel very comfortable.
      </p>

      <p>
        But here, if you have the patience to sit and listen to these words with
        the gaps, your spiritual restlessness will come down and the tendency of
        your mind to ask for the next thought will also come down. You
        automatically become receptive and these words will not only touch your
        head, but they will directly touch your heart as well. If you are
        totally relaxed and at ease with yourself without too many thoughts,
        your being will open, taking in everything and be healed.
      </p>

      <p>
        If your mind is calm, just listening is enough. There is no need to even
        meditate separately later. The very listening itself can create the
        experience in you. If your listening is not proper, then it is difficult
        for the experience to happen. J. Krishnamurti<sup
          id="love-heals-five-types-of-restlessness-ref2"
          ><a href="#love-heals-five-types-of-restlessness-2">2</a></sup
        >, the famous philosopher says, &ldquo;Listening is god.&rdquo; Deep and
        total listening without restlessness is divine. That itself is god. If
        you look deeply into your being, the very presence of the master that
        causes love to happen in you heals the spiritual restlessness.

      <h3>Love brings great courage</h3>

      <p>
        A beautiful incident happened in the life of Ramanuja<sup
          id="love-brings-great-courage-ref1"
          ><a href="#love-brings-great-courage-1">1</a></sup
        >. If you study the life of Ramanuja, you will see how he used every
        step of his life to move towards enlightenment.
      </p>

      <p class="p-story">
        When his teacher initiated Ramanuja, he gave him a special chant. The
        teacher told him not to pass on the chant to anybody and that if he did
        so, he would go to hell. Ramanuja asked him what would happen to the
        others with whom he might share it. The teacher said that they would be
        led to salvation.
      </p>

      <p class="p-story">
        What would we have done? Naturally we would have kept quiet, thinking,
        &ldquo;Why unnecessarily go to hell?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p class="p-story">
        Ramanuja immediately stood on a platform in a temple and called out to
        the whole village. He loudly pronounced the chant given by his teacher
        and told the people, &ldquo;Let you all go to heaven! I am not bothered
        about me going to hell. Let you all reach heaven!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        When you are deeply in love, you feel as if your whole being is open and
        you are ready to go to any extreme for the sake of anybody. You are
        ready to go to any boundary, as there is nothing to protect within your
        being. Your being is totally open. You don&rsquo;t feel insecure when
        you are wild with love. That is why people who are in love always do
        risky things. They take the risk because they feel they have nothing to
        lose. There is no insecurity about anything. They feel so expansive.
        Love gives tremendous courage and energy. It opens you up. It makes you
        finally available to yourself. As of now, you are not available to
        yourself. Love can make you available to yourself.
      </p>

      <p>
        When the teacher saw what Ramanuja did, he admitted that he learned a
        lesson from his disciple and declared that Ramanuja had reached greater
        heights than him. He told Ramanuja, &ldquo;You are in a different space
        now.&rdquo;

      <h3>Be open - not philosophizing</h3>

      <p>
        If you observe, you will have a very definite mental setup towards the
        people you live with everyday. You will practically know all the
        dialogues that might happen between you and them. You will know exactly
        that if you start the conversation in a particular way, in just what way
        the other person will respond! If you start the dialogue in another way,
        you will know exactly how the other person&rsquo;s response will change.
        You have a virtual script of all the possible everyday dialogues in your
        head.
      </p>

      <p>
        Only if someone comes up with a new dialogue or behavior are you a
        little shaken or disturbed, and you don&rsquo;t know how to answer or
        react. Those are the only few minutes you start wondering about how to
        respond. Otherwise, you know the dialogue for the whole day. You know
        how it should start, when it will take a turn and how it will end. It is
        a dead dialogue. There is no life in it.
      </p>

      <p>
        The problem is that we have all practically become philosophers. We
        don&rsquo;t understand that life is not philosophy. It is spontaneous
        flowing energy. It is new every moment. Philosophy is all about
        repeating the same old things in different ways, that&rsquo;s all.
        There&rsquo;s nothing fresh in it. Life is fresh every moment.
        Philosophy robs life of the freshness.
      </p>

      <p>A small story:</p>

      <p class="p-story">
        Ten philosophers were imprisoned in a country. They were kept together
        in one cell. They decided that somehow they should escape from the
        prison. They sat and made a big plan. They got the mold of the prison
        door key and made a duplicate key.
      </p>

      <p class="p-story">
        Finally, they chose the date of escape. The whole plan was clearly laid
        out. They decided that on the particular night, two of them will open
        the prison door with the duplicate key and signal to the others. The
        others would escape and these two would follow after locking the door
        behind them.
      </p>

      <p class="p-story">
        The day of escape dawned and two of them went to open the door. The rest
        of them waited for the signal. They waited and waited but never got any
        signal. Three hours passed. Suddenly the two who had gone to open the
        door came back and said, &ldquo;We have to drop our plan to escape. It
        can&rsquo;t happen today. We will have to do it some other day. We will
        have to reschedule our escape.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p class="p-story">The others asked, &ldquo;Why, what happened?&rdquo;</p>

      <p class="p-story">
        They replied, &ldquo;What to do? The foolish guards forgot to lock the
        prison door!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p class="p-story">
        The other nine philosophers were so disappointed that they decided to
        stay in the prison. They were not able to escape.
      </p>

      <p>
        Those who philosophize cannot think of anything new! It has to be the
        same old mental setup. If there is some change or some new situation,
        they cannot think creatively to deal with it, because they are not open.
        They are like a closed circuit.
      </p>

      <p>
        We have also become like philosophers when dealing with our lives. We
        are stuck in patterns of the past. We are never in the moment. If
        anything new happens, we are at a loss.
      </p>

      <p>
        The person who experiences the &ldquo;ever living presence&rdquo;
        experiences life in its freshness. He is also the one who is open and
        available. He constantly experiences the oneness with everything around
        him. Understand, being open means respecting every thing as equal to
        you. It means considering each other as equal and being open to change.
        &ldquo;Available&rdquo; means that you are clear that the source of
        everything in this universe is Existence and that you are available to
        it every moment. That is the meaning of being available. It is
        recognizing the profundity of Existence of which all things are part. If
        you are open and available, you are no more a philosopher. You are ready
        to open up to life with love.
      </p>

      <p>
        With philosophy, you have fixed ideas, and you become very assertive.
        When you are too assertive, you can&rsquo;t love. Assertion is an
        aggressiveness that does not allow love to come in. When you are too
        sure and filled with preconceived ideas, then where is the space for
        love to enter? Love needs beautiful space in order to blossom.
      </p>

      <p>
        With philosophy, there is no room for love to settle in its existential
        state. If you really want to experience the taste of nectar, can you
        experience it through just a set of ideas about it? No! You need to
        taste the nectar yourself, give it some space, allow it to fill you and
        settle in its existential state. Only then you will know its taste. In
        the same way, to experience love, just a few ideas alone will not help.
        You need to allow it to grow in its existential state in your inner
        space. Then you will know it. Allow it to happen in your heart, not in
        the head. Decide to be with the heart. Then it will grow and happen.
      </p>

      <p>
        What was once a failure within the head can become a success within the
        heart! Love is really a success of the heart that every individual
        should experience. It is easy to stay in the head. It is, after all, a
        mundane and familiar intellect. It requires courage to come down to the
        heart, because with the heart nothing is familiar, everything is fresh.
        At the head level you have a solid identity and familiar patterns. At
        the heart level there is no identity, no pattern. It is an open space.
        To enter into it, you need tremendous courage. That is why love is
        fearsome for many people. It is an unfamiliar zone. With the head, there
        is comfortable familiarity.

      <h3>Ego disconnects - Love connects</h3>

      <p>
        If the cosmos is a grand ocean, we are all part of it. We are one with
        the ocean, not individual drops in the ocean. When we think of ourselves
        as individual drops, we feel separate in our boundary and in our
        feelings. This is what is called ego. We become driven by feelings of
        &ldquo;I&rdquo; and &ldquo;mine&rdquo;. As long as this separation
        remains, we never experience the energy of the ocean that is love, we
        can never experience that causeless and surging love.
      </p>

      <p>
        As long as we remain a drop in the ocean, we say 'no' to life. We
        neither love nor trust. We don't feel blissful either because bliss is
        possible only for those who know how to love and trust. It happens only
        to those who know how to feel part of the ocean. Bliss is possible only
        when our heart says &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, when the &ldquo;no&rdquo;
        completely disappears from our being. &ldquo;No&rdquo; is darkness,
        &ldquo;yes&rdquo; is light. &ldquo;No&rdquo; is ego, &ldquo;yes&rdquo;
        is egolessness.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No&rdquo; is the way of the unconscious person. &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;
        is the way of the awakened one. All the conflict, all the suffering in
        our life is because of our saying &ldquo;no&rdquo;. &ldquo;No&rdquo; is
        a fight, a war with Existence. &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; is love, peace with
        Existence. &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; is deep accord with the totality of who we
        are - the ocean. Bliss is another name for that accord, that harmony.
      </p>

      <p>
        The way to be in bliss is to dissolve into the ocean, not to be a drop
        but to merge with the ocean. To be a drop is to be with ego. The ego is
        the root of all misery. When the ego is absent, bliss reaches us from
        every nook and corner of the ocean of existence, as if it were just
        waiting for the ego to disappear.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ego is a closed state of consciousness. All the windows and doors are
        closed. Life itself becomes insulated and encapsulated. Our ego
        surrounds us like a capsule. Our ego is like a sealed capsule; there is
        not even a small gap to allow anything to enter. It closes itself due to
        fear and shrinks into itself. That is how we create misery for
        ourselves.
      </p>

      <p>
        Love is being in the flow with Existence, to be totally with it. Ego is
        like frozen ice. Love is like liquid water. Only when we are liquid do
        we become part of the ocean. Then we don&rsquo;t have any private goal
        or destination. Each moment is blissful, incredibly ecstatic, just going
        with the plan of the cosmos.
      </p>

      <p>
        The mind is part of the ego. It knows how to close, but it does not know
        how to open. To love means to open up, to surrender. It means opening up
        to Existence, to the flowers, to the bees and to the stars. How do we
        open to this beautiful music that fills the whole of Existence? How do
        we open up to this celebration that goes on and on — flowers dancing in
        the wind, trees enjoying the wind and the stars, always in a state of
        bliss? Except for man, everything else seems to be in harmony.
      </p>

      <p>
        Man falls out of harmony because he has what is called
        &ldquo;consciousness&rdquo; which is not present in other living
        creatures.
      </p>

      <p>
        Consciousness can do two things. It can create ego or it can create
        egolessness. If it creates ego, we live in hell. If it creates
        egolessness, we live in paradise. The whole world is in paradise without
        knowing it. When man enters paradise, he enters knowing it fully. That
        is the grandeur and beauty of man. That is the danger as well, because
        it is easier to fall into the trap of the ego and not enter into
        paradise than to enter paradise knowingly.
      </p>

      <p>
        The problem is that we have forgotten who we are and for what we were
        created. We are emperors of love, but we dream that we are beggars. We
        have the whole kingdom of Existence within our being and yet we continue
        to beg for mundane things. We keep collecting mundane things not knowing
        that we have infinite, inexhaustible treasures within our being. We are
        oceans, yet we are thirsty because we have become disconnected from our
        own selves. But no matter how disconnected we are, no matter how much we
        have forgotten and how long we have forgotten, it can be remembered in a
        single moment and we can become connected immediately.
      </p>

      <p>Love is the connector.</p>

      <p>
        Bliss arises from love. Love is the poetry that connects you back to
        Existence. Love is the sword that slays the ego and merges you with the
        ocean. When the heart is full of love, your whole life is transformed
        from prose to poetry, from noise to music and from discord to harmony.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is such sheer joy to simply exist. Just &ldquo;to be&rdquo; is
        enough. But we need to be sensitive to feel the joy of being. We need to
        grow feelers. The feelers are what we call love. Love feels the joy of
        just being. When you grow the feelers of love, life is no longer made of
        independent thoughts but becomes a continuous feeling. Then the ego
        starts to dissolve. Once we have moved from thinking to feeling, there
        is only one more step and that is from feeling to being. That is very
        simple.
      </p>

      <p>
        The first step is difficult, to move from thinking to feeling. The ego
        has trained the mind to think so much, that&rsquo;s why. The second step
        comes almost automatically. There&rsquo;s nothing we need to do for it
        to happen. From feeling to being, the distance is nothing at all. It can
        happen at any moment. The poet can become the mystic at any moment. He
        is almost there. The real problem is how to get out of our thinking and
        get more and more into feeling.
      </p>

      <p>
        Just follow the heart. Just love more, that&rsquo;s all! Feel more.
        Enjoy more so that you can feed your heart. Watch the sunrise, sunset,
        clouds, rainbows, birds, flowers, animals, rocks, and people, and watch
        them with awareness. Look into their eyes. Existence is so
        multidimensional. Look into every dimension like a poet. Praise it. Feel
        it. Be ecstatic! Expand your consciousness and experience every single
        detail of Existence with love. Slowly, the ego will lose its hold and
        disappear.
      </p>

      <p>
        The only barrier to love is fear. When things start happening, we become
        fearful because with love we enter into a merger. This threatens the
        very basis of our ego. Ego is separateness while love is a merger. The
        fear we feel is nothing but the fear of the dissolving ego. Let the fear
        be there. It will hang around for a while. If we simply ignore it, the
        ego will leave us. It is a great day when fear of losing the ego leaves
        us. From then on growth becomes simple, easy and spontaneous. Then
        <em>we</em> are not, only <em>love</em> is.

      <h3>Be a lover every moment</h3>

      <p>
        Encounter any situation in life with deep love. Soon you will become
        pure love. Whether it is a person or your work or a passerby or god or
        anything, just encounter it with deep love for love&rsquo;s sake. If you
        are a painter, just be completely in love with painting. If you are a
        dancer, be completely in love with dancing. If you are working with your
        computer, treat it with utmost love and become lost in it. Just be
        completely sincere and completely in love every moment.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you are painting and at the same time thinking about which gallery to
        put up the painting in or how much to sell it for, then be very clear,
        you are not lost in love. You are in love only with some particular
        thing, which is money in this case. If you are dancing while calculating
        what you will get once you finish the dance, then be very clear you are
        not lost in love. You create more and vmore bondage by doing this. Even
        when a master happens in your life you do the same thing to him.
      </p>

      <p>
        I tell people, &ldquo;I am showing you the moon by pointing at it with
        my finger. If you look at the moon, you will experience what I
        experience. Instead if you cling to my finger, you will neither see the
        moon nor will you relax!
      </p>

      <p>
        If you become lost in every moment, you become love. Then, when you work
        you work with the utmost focus because you are in deep love with it.
        This way, your very life becomes a deep meditative love.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then you start feeling, relating and respecting everything as a living
        being, just as you are. You even start feeling the other person&rsquo;s
        thoughts. You start responding and relating to the other person without
        him or her opening up to you. You feel the cosmos as a translucent,
        ever-living presence. You have tremendous intelligence. You know exactly
        how to connect to things. Such is the power of love.
      </p>

      <p>
        Real love keeps you in the moment. It gives you tremendous awareness.
        That is why it is so powerful. Nothing is as intense as being in the
        moment. Love is experiencing life moment to moment, in its totality. And
        it is not about two persons or any object. It is just love for
        love&rsquo;s sake, that&rsquo;s all. If you get a glimpse of real love
        experienced in the moment, you can nurture it within you and make it
        grow to fill your whole being and life. That spark is enough!
      </p>

      <p>
        Then you become a wonderful creator because love energy is also creative
        energy. That is why poets express such creativity. They lose themselves
        in love and become blissful creators. Out of the freshness of the
        moment, the creativity happens.

      <h3>Love yourself first</h3>

      <p>
        The big problem today is that most people don&rsquo;t love themselves.
        Society never teaches that it is possible to love ourselves.
      </p>

      <p>
        Understand that unless you love yourself, you cannot possibly love
        another person. Only when you lose yourself to yourself can you lose
        yourself to others. We are taught that we can only love even ourselves
        if we have a reason. If we perform well, we love ourselves. If we fail,
        we hate ourselves. We apply the same logic to others. We love them only
        because of something, never without a cause or a reason.
      </p>

      <p>
        When you don&rsquo;t love yourself, you become cynical and negative
        towards life. When you were alone in your mother&rsquo;s womb, you were
        completely loving and blissful. In your aloneness in the womb you
        experienced your loving self. That is why you will see that you assume
        the fetal posture whenever you lie down with insecurity. Blissful
        aloneness is your original nature. Once you came into the world, society
        conditioned you to believe that you needed people and television to be
        loving and happy. It never nurtured your original quality. Your original
        quality is blissful aloneness. If you get back in touch with that, you
        will settle down and feel peaceful and relaxed within yourself.
      </p>

      <p>
        For a few minutes every day, just sit by yourself and feel overflowing
        love towards yourself. Feel what a wonderful being you are. Feel how
        much you have taken yourself for granted. Feel yourself as part of
        Existence and love yourself for it. Melt with the feeling of love for
        yourself. If you practice this everyday you will see that where you were
        once hard and self-centered, now you have become soft and loving.
      </p>

      <p>
        When you deeply settle down within yourself with peace and love, bliss
        will explode in you. When your nerves are clean, when your nervous
        system is cleaned by peace, bliss will explode. You will start
        expressing the same bliss that is expressed in the master&rsquo;s body
        language.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then when people love you, you don&rsquo;t feel guilty or unworthy
        because just as they love you, you love yourself too. You become ready
        to receive love from others. Usually when others show love to you, you
        feel guilty or unworthy because you don&rsquo;t feel you are worth being
        loved. Once you settle within yourself with deep love, you will receive
        others&rsquo; love with joy.

      <h3>Love Existence and feel It loving you</h3>

      <p>
        Existence is not a thing. It is a living energy being. Every single
        tree, every single stalk of a plant responds to your love and hate, your
        every thought.
      </p>

      <p>
        Cleve Backster<sup id="love-existence-and-feel-it-loving-you-ref1"

        >, a polygraph expert, has conducted several experiments to examine the
        response of plants to human emotions and thoughts. He discovered that
        plants would respond to human thought in a way similar to how a human
        being would respond. A simple thought by a person about burning the
        leaves of the plant would register erratic movement in the polygraph
        recording of the plant! Backster called this response &ldquo;Primary
        Perception&rdquo; - the ability of plant, animal and human cells to
        perceive and respond to any thought.
      </p>

      <p>
        On one occasion, Backster recorded graphs that registered a flat line
        that suggested the plants were in a state of shock. He asked the owner
        of the plant if she had done anything to hurt the plants. The lady told
        him, &ldquo;I roasted a few of its leaves to get their dry
        weight!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        When you start loving Existence, it begins responding to you in
        beautiful ways. You start rising above all of the differences around you
        - differences between people, situations, emotions, between anything and
        anything. Everything merges into unity. And that is the truth.
        Everything is part of one Whole. And love is the only thing that can
        make you realize this truth.
      </p>

      <p>
        In India, there is a tradition of spiritual wandering where people walk
        by foot the length and breadth of the country, visiting many temples and
        pilgrim centers. I used to wonder how they were able to do that,
        especially going through forests, sleeping with wild animals and begging
        for food. The secret is that they start feeling connected with nature so
        completely that nature protects them beautifully. Whether it rains or
        shines, the animals and trees, everything, takes care of them. Even
        though this may be logically difficult to understand, it is the truth.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you begin to live with a little respect and love for Existence and
        all its creations, you will be able to recognize these things happening
        in your own life as well. Nature will simply reciprocate your love in
        many beautiful ways.

      <h3>Love is different from respect</h3>

      <p>
        Very often, love is confused with respect. From a young age, children
        are brought up to always show respect but never to show love. You can
        hear people teach the children, &ldquo;You should respect your
        elders.&rdquo; You will hardly hear, &ldquo;You should love your
        elders.&rdquo; That is the problem.
      </p>

      <p>
        Respect sows the first guilt in you that you are something inferior. It
        makes you feel separate from the other person to whom you show respect.
        On the other hand, love sows the seeds of joy and unity in you. It makes
        you feel connected with the other person and with everything in
        Existence. With respect, there is fear. With love, there is authentic
        respect as well as the scope for deep understanding to happen. With
        respect alone, not much understanding is possible. With love, there is a
        possibility for tremendous understanding and transformation to happen.
        Love by its very nature is transforming. It softens and melts you.

        The scholar Professor Nicholson, composed a Sufi<sup

        verse on love:
      </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Love, Love alone can kill what seemed dead,</p>

      <p>the frozen snake of passion. Love alone</p>

      <p>By tearful prayers and fiery longing fed,</p>

      <p>Reveals a knowledge schools have never known.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>
        Any stone heart can be melted with love. Only love can melt your
        hardness. Only love can keep you porous.
      </p>

      <p>
        Respect creates distance between you and the other. Love bridges the
        distance between you and the other. Only because people themselves have
        not experienced love, do they give respect as the rule of acceptable
        behavior. Respect is easier but not real. Love might be difficult only
        because not many know how to go about it, but it is real. With love,
        respect is automatic and authentic. With pure respect, the appearance of
        love is forced and may never be authentic.

      <h3>Love is the root of all religion</h3>

      <p>
        Love is the original religion. It is the root of all spirituality. All
        other religions are offshoots. Love is like the root of the tree and all
        religions are like leaves or branches. Even the greatest religions are
        only big branches compared to the religion of love!
      </p>

      <p>
        Love has no temple or scripture. It is like the roots that lie beneath
        the ground but provide the nourishment for life. Without it, the whole
        tree dies. Through love many branches and leaves are created. But what
        do we do? We cling to the branches and leaves instead of clinging to the
        root. When we cling to the root, we get the direct nourishment. When we
        cling to the branches, we enjoy only one dimension of the nourishment.
        When you become more loving, you will enter the invisible temple of
        love.
      </p>

      <p>
        Tree roots contain the information about all the trees in this world,
        just like a dewdrop contains information about all the oceans in the
        world. If we understand the structure of a drop of water, we will
        understand everything about all the oceans on earth. We will understand
        the compound called water itself. Water anywhere cannot be anything
        other than its chemical composition. That composition is ingrained in
        the smallest particle, and that is the dew drop.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the same way, man is an atom of love. And love is nothing but the
        quality of Existence. If love is known, the whole of Existence can be
        experienced. Understand that the composition of man is not physical,
        chemical or even psychological, it is spiritual. Nobody can teach us
        what it is. We must experience it on our own. All other knowledge is
        transferable: physical, chemical, scientific and psychological. All such
        knowledge is easily transferable. Only spiritual knowledge is not. It
        cannot be taught as such, but it can be experienced!
      </p>

      <p>A small story:</p>

      <p class="p-story">
        One day a master asked his disciples how they could tell when the night
        had ended and the day had begun.
      </p>

      <p class="p-story">
        One of them said, &ldquo;When you can look in the distance and tell
        whether the animal is a cow or a horse.&rdquo; The master said,
        &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p class="p-story">
        Another disciple said, &ldquo;When you can look at a tree in the
        distance and tell if it is a pine tree or a mango tree.&rdquo; The
        master again said, &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p class="p-story">
        They asked the master, &ldquo;Then what is it master?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p class="p-story">
        The master replied, &ldquo;When you can look into the face of any man
        and recognize your brother in him. When you can look into the face of
        any woman and recognize your sister in her. If you cannot do this, then
        no matter what time of the day it is, it is still only night
        time.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The master can give a few hints, little hints here and there. Then we
        must find our own way carefully, cautiously. Love is just a hint, but if
        we follow love slowly, very slowly, we will be surprised that god
        becomes more and more of a reality. He is no longer just a thought, no
        longer simply an idea, but something that we can feel. The deeper we go
        into love, the closer we come to the feeling. The day we dissolve into
        love we merge with unity.
      </p>

      <p>
        Love is the secret of all religions. In spite of this, people are lost
        in logic and theology. Theology is as far away from religion as anything
        can be. There can be no logic about god, there can be only love. God is
        in poetry. He is in music and in dance, but never in logic.
      </p>

      <p>
        God is not an idea that can be arrived at through logical processes. He
        is an interior experience, so deeply interior that one must go there
        absolutely alone to discover it.
      </p>

      <p>
        From time immemorial, the conclusion of many mystics has been that
        matter is glued together with love. An invisible force keeps atoms and
        molecules together. They do not fall apart because of this invisible
        force. Science has yet to discover this ultimate energy. It has detected
        a few of its manifestations such as gravitation and electricity but
        these are only gross manifestations. The day that science discovers love
        will be the day when religion and science will commune with each other
        in the same language.

      <p>
        For now, just rejoice because love is possible. Be joyful that love is
        your inner potential. You can rise to the ultimate heights with love.
        Nothing is impossible with love because love can transform itself into
        god.

      <h3>Three types of Love and their integration</h3>

      <p>
        Many people confuse lust with love. This is one of the greatest
        tragedies. The person who thinks lust is love remains confined to the
        physical plane. He never rises higher than that. He has no idea that
        there is a higher plane. He remains in the basement of his house. Sex is
        the basement. It is not the place to live in. You can use it for other
        purposes, but it can&rsquo;t be your home. Your home is above it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Man has three planes of being, which are animal, human and divine. First
        is the plane of lust, which is the animal plane. It is a crude form of
        love. It is not that love is not present there. Love is mixed or
        polluted by gross greed and desire, that&rsquo;s all.
      </p>

      <p>
        As our being becomes more refined, we enter the second plane, ordinary
        human love. Human love has traces of possessiveness and jealousy. Since
        human love is grounded in greater understanding than animal love, one
        does not simply use the other person for his or her own gain. Human love
        is capable of seeing the other as an end unto itself.
      </p>

      <p>
        The third type of love is divine love. It is love in its highest form,
        almost like a prayer. There is no possessiveness. There is nothing
        earthly in it. It becomes an invisible but powerful force. This is when
        love becomes prayer and we feel restful contentment for the first time.
        I say restful because the other two types of love always keep reaching
        for more or keep missing something. There is no restfulness in them.
        When the third type of love happens, even sex becomes a deep and divine
        act beyond mere physical pleasure.
      </p>

      <p>
        In India, people consider the place where three rivers meet to be
        sacred. It is a metaphor because man is a meeting place of three forces:
        physical, psychological and spiritual. When these three forces
        <em>really</em> meet, there is great joy and bliss.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ordinarily we live in compartments. Our body lives in one compartment,
        our mind lives in another and our soul lives in a third compartment. The
        body is unaware of the mind. The mind is unaware of the body. The soul
        is not known to the mind. The body is oblivious of the soul. They are
        together but they don&rsquo;t know each other.
      </p>

      <p>
        The first step of meditation is to bring them closer together, to
        introduce them to each other and link them in a deep friendship so that
        a merger becomes possible. When all three dimensions merge into one
        point, the fourth dimension is born. Out of the meeting of the three,
        the fourth is born. That fourth is god or Existence or Divinity or
        whatever you wish to call it. The whole work of spirituality is to
        create an alchemy in which the body melts into the mind, the mind melts
        into the soul, the soul melts into the mind, and the mind melts into the
        body. By and by, slowly, very slowly, they become one integrated
        phenomenon. Love is the outcome of it.

      <h3>Enter into causeless Love</h3>

      <p>
        People tell me they feel such exuding love towards me. I always tell
        them, use that flowing love as a gateway to jump towards the whole of
        humanity. The love towards the master is like food. If you digest it,
        you become energetic and you radiate the same energy in your life.
      </p>

      <p>
        Buddha<sup id="enter-into-causeless-love-ref1"
          ><a href="#enter-into-causeless-love-1">1</a></sup

        says, &ldquo;I live in the commune.&rdquo; He means, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
        direct your attention towards me. Direct your attention towards the
        whole world.&rdquo; If the object of love is removed, then the whole
        world becomes the object. Then you will never enter into suffering.
      </p>

      <p>
        The first thing we need to understand is that relationships can happen
        causelessly, without any reason. Only then will we understand that the
        experience of love is much more important than the object of love.
      </p>

      <p>
        You must have at least one relationship in your life that exists for no
        reason. If you don&rsquo;t have such a relationship, be very clear, even
        if you have money, deep down you are still poor.
      </p>

      <p>
        From today onwards start relating with someone for no reason. There
        should be no monetary or physical benefit from the relationship. If you
        experience causeless love once, after that, if the money is shared, if
        the body is shared, it is okay. The quality is totally different. I am
        not against money or against marriage. I am not against the physical
        relationship, but if it becomes the center of your life, you are missing
        something very important. That is what I want to convey here. You miss a
        major dimension or energy center of your being.
      </p>

      <p>I am reminded of a small story:</p>

      <p class="p-story">
        There was a blind girl who hated herself because she was blind. She
        hated everyone except her boyfriend.
      </p>

      <p class="p-story">
        The girl told her boyfriend that if she could only see the world, she
        would marry him.
      </p>

      <p class="p-story">
        A few days later, her doctor told her that someone donated a pair of
        eyes to her. She underwent the surgery and she opened her eyes to see
        everything, including her boyfriend.
      </p>

      <p class="p-story">
        Her boyfriend asked her, &ldquo;Now that you can see, will you marry
        me?&rdquo; The girl was shocked when she saw that her boyfriend was
        blind. She said, &ldquo;I am sorry but I can&rsquo;t marry you because
        you are blind.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p class="p-story">
        Her boyfriend walked away sadly. He told her just one thing, &ldquo;Just
        take care of my eyes, dear.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        That is why it is said that you have to create your being. You have to
        awaken the center of love in you. You should have at least one
        relationship in your life from which you do not expect anything beyond
        just the relationship. You should develop one relationship in which you
        do not receive any utility from that relationship, be it monetary or
        physical comfort or name and fame. Have at least one relationship... it
        could even be with a tree or the moon or the sun. The criterion is that
        you should not have any benefit from the relationship. Only then you
        will understand the word &ldquo;love&rdquo;. Only then the love center
        in you will be awakened.
      </p>

      <p>
        I always tell people, &ldquo;Do some work for half hour everyday that
        does not bring you money or name and fame. Just for half an hour, go to
        some temple or church, clean and sweep the floor, offer some service.
        Don&rsquo;t plan to become a committee member in that place! Don&rsquo;t
        think that it will fetch you good credit and a place in heaven... no.
        Don&rsquo;t look any further than that work for half an hour.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Initially you may think, &ldquo;This half hour is a waste of
        time!&rdquo; After a few days you will realize that only in that half
        hour are you really alive! Only for that half hour you are not driven by
        fear or greed. You smile at the people around you without any
        calculation. You feel strangely sincere in a way that you never felt
        before.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you observe yourself at other times, you will see that you even smile
        only after some mental calculation. Even before laughing you will see
        who is the person next to you. Based on that, you decide how many inches
        to open your mouth, how polite you should be, how you should project
        yourself. To overcome these conditionings, just for half an hour try
        this technique that does not bring you money, that does not bring you
        name and fame, that does not give you any social position, that does not
        give you anything in return. Then you will understand what I mean by the
        words &ldquo;causeless relationship&rdquo;. You will see that soon only
        that half hour becomes the real life for you!
      </p>

      <p>
        As of now, every action of yours is driven by fear and greed. You are
        fuelled by fear and greed. That&rsquo;s why you feel lonely and tired.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you try this technique, you will suddenly see that your body and mind
        start functioning without the need for fear and greed! Once you learn
        this simple knack of how to move your body without fear and greed, be
        very clear, you can enter into love. You learn how to tap into the
        energy of love. You learn how to run your life on the beautiful energy
        of love. Only then will you know what is meant by the word
        &ldquo;love&rdquo;.
      </p>

      <p>
        A new center will be awakened in you. A new energy will start radiating
        in you. Then you will understand how loving and causeless relationships
        are possible.

      <h3>Love, hatred and attention-need</h3>

      <p>
        As long as love is conditional, hatred and love are opposite sides of
        the same coin. Love can flip into hatred the moment we feel that our
        expectations are threatened.
      </p>

      <p>
        In love of this type, it remains love only as long as the conditions
        remain as expected. The moment the conditions change, the love also
        changes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Often what we believe as love is actually related to time and space. So
        long as the distance between the lovers is large and the time of contact
        is minimal, they feel love towards each other. However, once they get
        closer and spend more time together, they feel that they are not so much
        in love after all! That is why they say &ldquo;familiarity breeds
        contempt&rdquo;. Familiarity can also convert love into hatred. To
        transcend both love and hatred, we first need to drop expectations.
        Expectation is the first enemy of love.
      </p>

      <p>
        We all go through several stages of relationships in our lifetime. If
        you observe very closely, whichever stage we are in, when we ask for
        love we are actually asking only for the other person&rsquo;s attention.
        When we say a person doesn&rsquo;t love us, we actually mean that the
        other person doesn&rsquo;t give us enough attention. The basic need for
        any human being is attention from others. The attention-need, along with
        our dependency on others for survival, is what we experience as love.
      </p>

      <p>
        The dependency on others might be psychological, physical or spiritual.
        For example, when you expect someone to lend you a shoulder to cry on,
        you are dependent upon him or her psychologically. When you expect
        someone to provide you with money or fulfill your bodily pleasures, you
        are dependent upon him or her physically. In whatever way people may
        fulfill this dependency, what it boils down to is the attention that
        they give us! The whole idea of love is nothing but getting the
        attention of the other in some way.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the first session of our meditation camp, I ask people to make an
        honest list of at least one or two persons in their lives who they
        really love. Usually in the beginning, people come up with a big list:
        husband, wife, father, mother, brother, sister and so on. They include
        people whom they would like to please or need to please in order to be
        happy themselves. As they hear me talk about real love, they start
        crossing out names from their list one by one! Understand, if you cross
        out something, then it was not truly there in the first place.
      </p>

      <p>
        Many people include certain people in their love list because these
        people give them a &ldquo;feel good&rdquo; feeling. What do I mean by a
        &ldquo;feel good&rdquo; feeling? It is a certificate saying, &ldquo;You
        are good. You are this, you are that&rdquo; etc. We love anyone who pays
        us compliments, is it not? We think twice before arguing with them. We
        secretly nurture our good name with them in the name of love. If they go
        back on their approval of us, we might fall into depression, so we
        continue to please them and love them. Like this, there is always some
        hidden reason for our love.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some people tell me, &ldquo;No <em>Swamiji</em>, I don&rsquo;t love my
        son or daughter for any of these reasons.&rdquo; I ask them,
        &ldquo;Alright, if your son suddenly starts to make his own decisions,
        if he suddenly doesn&rsquo;t fit into your framework, if he
        doesn&rsquo;t follow your guidance, if he doesn&rsquo;t live according
        to your rules, will your love for him be the same?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        They tell me, &ldquo;No, it will not. My love will be reduced a
        little!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        What does this mean? We love our next generation as long as they are
        extensions of our life. As long as they fall into our pattern of
        thinking, as long as they live in accordance with our conventions, we
        love them. We simply fulfill our own desires through them. We fulfill
        our lives through them. Whatever we couldn&rsquo;t accomplish in our
        youth, we try to accomplish through them. We use them as an extension of
        our own lives. If we wanted to be doctors and couldn&rsquo;t for some
        reason, we inspire them to be doctors. As long as they act and live as
        an extension of our life, the relationship is beautiful. But the moment
        they start deciding on their own, the moment they feel we are
        suffocating them, the moment they stand up and say &ldquo;no&rdquo;, the
        relationship takes a different turn.
      </p>

      <p>A small story:</p>

      <p class="p-story">
        There were three grownups having their morning tea together. Their
        children were playing on the floor. They were discussing what they would
        do if danger threatened, and all of them declared that the first thing
        they would do was pick up their children and escape.
      </p>

      <p class="p-story">
        Suddenly, the safety valve of the pressure cooker burst, creating a
        steam explosion in the room. Within seconds, everyone was out of the
        kitchen - except for the children playing on the floor!
      </p>

      <p>
        Our love is not as great as we claim it to be! Even we don&rsquo;t know
        the real depth of our love, that&rsquo;s the problem. We say and do a
        lot of things in the name of love. But reality can be shockingly
        different from all that. If we integrate the love emotion in us, it can
        become a highly sincere and authentic expression of our original nature.
      </p>

    <div id="the-unity-of-love" class="chapter-container">
      <h3>The unity of Love</h3>

      <p>
        Children feel that they are adults only when they say &ldquo;no&rdquo;
        to their parents. It is a basic instinct. When they say &ldquo;no&rdquo;
        they feel that they are established as an individual. That is why, all
        over the world, youngsters always rebel. Whether it is in the West or in
        the East, in all the countries all over the world, in all the cultures,
        the youth say &ldquo;no&rdquo;. When they say &ldquo;no&rdquo;, they
        feel they are strong.
      </p>

      <p>
        But our love is dependent only on &ldquo;yes&rdquo;. As long as we
        receive &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, our love also is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;. When we
        get a &ldquo;no&rdquo;, we also start saying &ldquo;no&rdquo;. This is
        called horizontal love. It starts and ends horizontally. It starts again
        and ends again. It always ends with some reason or other. There is
        another love called vertical love. It never ends because it never
        starts. It is always there in the form of energy. It is consciousness.
        Vertical love is when we suddenly realize that we are living inside
        everybody just as we live inside our own body!

      <p class="p-story">

        If you are able to experience yourself as being alive in all the bodies
        of this world, imagine how much joy or ecstasy you would experience! It
        would be immeasurable, eternal and ultimate. That is what enlightened
        people experience all the time. They experience themselves as the whole
        universe. They experience tremendous ecstasy. That is why they don't
        need anything from the outer world. They are enough unto themselves.
        They are established in the highest form of love energy.

        superconscious being, gave her the experience of seeing him
        simultaneously with every single cowherd girl present there. He wanted

      <h2>Love and liberate, don&rsquo;t possess</h2>

      <p>
        As long as our love happens towards a particular object, even if the
        object is a person, we will try to reduce that person only to the level
        of an object. That is exactly what we do when we feel possessive or
        attached to another person. In the way that we try to possess furniture
        or a house or any object, we try to possess the person also. We want the
        person to be just how we want him or her to be, which means we are
        actually reducing the person to sheer matter.
      </p>

      <p>
        So understand, whenever our love or our attention is towards something
        in particular, we will be only materialistic, we will be creating
        suffering for ourselves and for others. We will only suffocate the
        object or person. Instead, if we turn our attention towards the
        experience of love itself, we will be liberating the object and we too
        will be liberated from the object. That is the beauty of love that
        happens just as love and not for the sake of any object.
      </p>

      <p>
        When you start possessing someone, you bind yourself also. If you are
        walking holding your dog&rsquo;s leash, be very clear that you are also
        bound. Don&rsquo;t think only the dog is bound. You are also bound.
        Don&rsquo;t think that only the dog cannot run away, you too cannot run
        away! You may be thinking that you are holding the rope and the dog may
        be thinking that he is holding the rope. Who knows?
      </p>

      <p>
        We always place our attention in the wrong space and miss the truth.
        When we place our attention on an object, we miss the inner experience
        of love that happens. We misunderstand that the excitement and the joy
        of love happens because of the object. We don&rsquo;t understand that
        the excitement or the joy of love happens not because of the object but
        because of us. It is an energy that happens in us. If it was because of
        the object, then whenever the object came in contact with us, we would
        have the same excitement, am I right? But it does not happen that way.
        Even if the object continues to be there, the temperature of the
        excitement comes down after some time, which means that the excitement
        or the energy is not related to the object. It is related to the
        subject, which is us. It is related to the experience itself, not to the
        object.
      </p>

      <p>A small story:</p>

      <p class="p-story">
        An art collector traveled to a village. He saw a cat drinking milk from
        an old antique saucer outside a small tea shop. The art collector
        recognized the value of the saucer and wished to buy it.
      </p>

      <p class="p-story">
        He approached the shop owner and asked him, &ldquo;Sir, can I buy this
        cat for two dollars?&rdquo; The shop owner refused saying he
        didn&rsquo;t want to sell the cat.
      </p>

      <p class="p-story">
        The art collector said, &ldquo;I want a cat because my house is haunted
        by mice. Please sell the cat to me. I am ready to pay ten
        dollars.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p class="p-story">
        The shop owner said, &ldquo;Fine, sold! Have it!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p class="p-story">
        Now the art collector said, &ldquo;I will take the cat but can you give
        me the saucer also? Then I don&rsquo;t have to buy a new saucer. The cat
        will be happy since she is already trained for this saucer. Why
        don&rsquo;t you give me the saucer too?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p class="p-story">
        The shop owner said, &ldquo;No! That&rsquo;s my lucky saucer. Only
        because of that I have sold sixty eight cats in the last one
        week!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The art collector wanted to get the saucer but got only the cat. We too
        miss what has to be really experienced in life because we go after the
        object and not the subject.
      </p>

      <p>
        The next time you are with someone, when you are with your friend with
        whom you are completely open, remember to practice this technique.
      </p>

      <p>
        Just sit next to him or her. Don&rsquo;t bother about what you are going
        to do or what you are going to say. Just sit, that&rsquo;s all! That is
        the technique. Actually, speaking is nothing but avoiding the other
        person. Because you cannot look into the other person&rsquo;s eyes, you
        go on speaking. That is the truth. The other person listens so that he
        can start speaking whenever you take a break! If a person is listening
        to you, it means that he is either thinking of something else or he is
        preparing for his turn. He sits there so that he can start once you
        finish.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now if you try this technique, it can take you to a different space
        altogether. When you are with the master or your friend or your beloved,
        whoever you feel deeply connected with, whoever you are very open with,
        you can try this technique. It will straightaway lead you to
        enlightenment. Be very clear, I am not teaching this technique for you
        to have better relationships or for you to develop your personality. No!
        I am giving it to you to straightaway experience the pure love that can
        lead you to enlightenment.
      </p>

      <p>
        The big problem is that you never sit in a relaxed way. Either you are
        driven by greed, meaning you are in a hurry to say or do something, or
        you don&rsquo;t know what you are doing and so you are caught with fear.
        You just try to finish your job and escape! Either you are in greed or
        you are in fear. But for now, just relax. Be neither in fear nor in
        greed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Just sit in the present. Just feel the other person&rsquo;s presence.
        Accept the other person as he or she is, as that being is, and feel what
        happens inside you. Try this for a few days. Suddenly you will see that
        you will experience a different space, one you have never before
        experienced in your life.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is a technique from the
        <em>Shiva Sutras</em
        ><sup id="love-and-liberate-dont-possess-ref1"
          ><a href="#love-and-liberate-dont-possess-1">1</a></sup
        >, a collection of techniques for enlightenment delivered by Shiva<sup
          id="love-and-liberate-dont-possess-ref2"
          ><a href="#love-and-liberate-dont-possess-2">2</a></sup
        >. This technique will take you through a quantum jump from the form to
        the formless, from possessive love to causeless love.
      </p>

      <p>
        You may be attached to your beloved or god or master or friend or
        whomever. To move from that attachment, to move from the form to the
        formless, this is the technique. You can take a quantum jump into love
        with this. With this jump you will see that love happens not as an
        attachment to a particular object but as an overflowing energy that
        doesn&rsquo;t look for any attachment in the outer world. It is just
        your own overflowing that you share, that&rsquo;s all. It happens
        irrespective of whether the object is there or not.
      </p>

      <p>
        When love happens as causeless overflowing, you simply liberate yourself
        and the other person from your own attachment and possessiveness,
        because possessiveness as you know it, binds not only the other person
        but you as well. It tortures the other person as well as you! Real love
        simply liberates both of you. It gives freedom to you and the other
        person.
      </p>

      <p>
        When I travel around the world, people ask me, &ldquo;Did you sleep well
        last night? It is a new place for you.&rdquo; I tell them, &ldquo;Only
        when you have attachment to a particular house does another house become
        a new place for you and you struggle. When you don&rsquo;t have
        attachment to any house, you feel at home wherever you go!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        I never feel any place is mine or not mine. I feel totally at home
        anywhere. The comfort is always within us, never outside us. When there
        is no comfort within us, we look for comfort outside us. Feeling
        comfortable within us is the result of the causeless love energy. When
        we don&rsquo;t feel attached to one home, we feel at home in the entire
        world. We are totally relaxed anywhere in the world.
      </p>

      <p>
        People ask me, &ldquo;<em>Swamiji</em>, how are you able to travel so
        often and not feel unsettled?&rdquo; This question comes mostly from
        people who travel for business. They say, &ldquo;If we go go to one or
        two places and come back, it takes one week to recover, settle down and
        get back into our routine and feel comfortable, to feel like ourselves
        again. How do you travel so continuously?&rdquo; The secret is the same
        thing I told you earlier. I don&rsquo;t feel attached or connected to
        any one house, so I feel connected to the whole world! There is a deep
        feeling of being at home with the whole world. With this feeling,
        wherever you go, you will experience a deep, relaxed bliss and ecstasy
        because that bliss doesn&rsquo;t come from the outer home but from the
        inner home.

      <h2>Love in relationships</h2>

      <p>
        In real life, we always look to express our love towards others in some
        tangible way. Only if love is demonstrated in tangible form, it is
        considered to be love nowadays.
      </p>

      <p>
        True love is like a communion. It is a resonance between two beings. It
        can be felt without any expression. It doesn&rsquo;t need communication
        because it is already happening as a communion.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you really love a person, then your very body language will show it.
        It will be too much to express in words. You will feel that words are
        inadequate and will only bring down the love that you feel. But if you
        are using words, then somewhere the love has not really happened. When
        you have to speak to express love, then somewhere there is a lie in it!
        You are using the words just to decorate the lie.
      </p>

      <p>
        Real love liberates because it doesn&rsquo;t compel you to express it
        all the time. It just is. Real love also gives you the freedom to freely
        express what you want to express. You can easily express anything like
        disapproval or anger and it will not be mistaken for reduced love.
      </p>

      <p>
        Not only that, with real love, there will be no domination or power play
        in relationships. Each person will be like a beautiful flower that has
        blossomed to radiate its unique fragrance, that&rsquo;s all.
      </p>

      <p>
        With real love, there will be no fear or insecurity either. In normal
        love, physical distance between two people causes a lot of insecurity
        and a lack of trust.
      </p>

      <p>A small story:</p>

      <p class="p-story">
        A young soldier went to his senior officer and said, &ldquo;Sir, my
        friend is not yet back from the battlefield. I request permission to go
        out and get him.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p class="p-story">
        The officer said, &ldquo;Permission refused. Your friend is most
        probably dead. I don&rsquo;t want you to risk your life going
        there.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p class="p-story">
        The young soldier went all the same and came back mortally wounded and
        carrying the corpse of his friend.
      </p>

      <p class="p-story">
        The officer was furious. He shouted, &ldquo;I told you he was dead. Now
        I have lost both of you. Tell me, was it worth going out there to bring
        a corpse?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p class="p-story">
        On the verge of dying, the soldier replied, &ldquo;It was, Sir. When I
        got there he was still alive. He said to me, I was sure you would
        come.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Real love doesn&rsquo;t look for utility. It operates on sheer trust and
        is also beyond space and time.
      </p>

      <p>
        These days I see people gifting each other with so many things to show
        their love. Gifting has become an expression of love. If the gifting
        happens as causeless overflowing, it is okay. But if it is a condition
        to be fulfilled, it becomes a problem! Then it becomes a poor substitute
        for real love.
      </p>

      <p>
        As long as real love is there, no relationship can become boring.
        Understand, as long as love is there, every object or person is unique.
        For example, if the coworker in your office dies, nothing will really
        stop you in your life. Along with the others, you will console his
        family members and continue with life, that&rsquo;s all. But what
        happens if you are in love with the same coworker who passed away? Life
        will never be the same again, am I right? Whenever you are in love with
        some object or person, or somebody is in love with you, the whole
        relationship becomes unique. Love makes things unique.
      </p>

      <p>
        One of the ashramites<sup id="love-in-relationships-ref1"
          ><a href="#love-in-relationships-1">1</a></sup
        >
        asked me one day, &ldquo;<em>Swamiji</em>, everyday you see all of us,
        all our mistakes and confusions. It is the same thing for you every day.
        Are you not bored by us?&rdquo; It was a very honest question! I told
        them, &ldquo;For enlightened beings, just because of their very love,
        they feel everybody is unique. They do not look at people as mere
        numbers. They see each one as unique.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        That is why, with so much patience, masters continue to work with
        everybody. If it were just a matter of numbers, it would be very
        different. When you have this love, your inner space is such that there
        is no logical reason behind your actions. You will just feel connected
        and you will radiate love, that&rsquo;s all!
      </p>

      <p>
        Not only that, causeless overflowing love is always total in its
        expression. It doesn&rsquo;t carry the usual dilutions of greed or fear.
        So any person whom you love, you will love totally without any
        reservations. Irrespective of the way he is, you will love him. When you
        love this way, even if the person leaves your life, you will not grieve.
      </p>

      <p>
        When a person passes away, you grieve only because you regret not having
        loved him completely. You can love him completely only when your love
        itself is complete. It doesn&rsquo;t have anything to do with the other
        person. It doesn&rsquo;t matter what kind of person he is. That is the
        beauty of real love. It loves for the sake of love, not for the sake of
        the other person.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you are grieving for the loss of a person, be very clear, you are
        grieving because you missed loving him in totality. If you had loved him
        in totality, you would say goodbye to him with complete restfulness, not
        with grief. You grieve only because you missed something somewhere. Even
        if it is your own father or husband or wife, it is the same. If you had
        radiated your causeless love to them when they were alive, then when
        they left there would not be any regret. But if you had loved them with
        rationalizations, then when they left, the incompleteness of your love
        towards them would create a hangover, and that hangover is what you feel
        as grief.

      <h3>What is Worry?</h3>

      <p>
        We talked of love so far. Love is about our relationship with others.
        Love is also about our relationship with ourselves. Without loving
        ourselves we cannot love others. What prevents us from loving our own
        self is the constant worry or irritation that we generate within us.
        Whether things go right or wrong we worry. There is nothing more
        corrosive to our self-esteem than worry. What is this worry?
      </p>

      <p>A small story:</p>

      <p class="p-story">A man walked into a bar looking worried and upset.</p>

      <p class="p-story">
        The bartender asked him, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter? You look very
        worried about something.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p class="p-story">
        The man said, &ldquo;My wife and I had a fight and she told me that she

        Everyone has his or her own set of worries! If I ask you what you worry
        about, you will tell me, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have a job, that&rsquo;s
        my worry.&rdquo; Your neighbor will say, &ldquo;My job is my main
        worry!&rdquo; Someone else will say, &ldquo;My children are my
        worry.&rdquo; Another person will say, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have
        children, that&rsquo;s my worry!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        One person&rsquo;s dream is another person&rsquo;s worry! You will not
        find any logic in it at all.
      </p>

      <p>
        What is meant by &ldquo;worry&rdquo;? Worry arises whenever things are
        not happening as you want them to happen. It is the discrepancy between
        your expectations and reality. For example, you feel your son should
        stay at home with you, whereas he feels he should be by himself, away
        from you. You feel your salary should be a few thousand dollars more.
        Your boss feels otherwise. You want to finish your project by a certain
        time. But things are happening too slowly and it seems an impossible
        task. These are all causes for worry. What you want and expect does not
        match what others want and expect.
      </p>

      <p>
        You continuously expect things to happen in a certain way. Whether it is
        as big as your career or as small as what time your husband should come
        home for a meal, you continuously impose your will upon what is
        happening and worry about it.
      </p>

      <h3>How does Worry take root?</h3>

      <p>
        Worry takes root from your own thoughts or words. There are two things
        that continuously happen in you. The first is dialogue, and the second
        is monologue or what I call &ldquo;inner chatter&rdquo;. You either talk
        to people outside or you continuously chatter within you. In any case,
        words and thoughts are the &ldquo;building blocks&rdquo; that make up
        worry.
      </p>

      <p>
        When you speak to others, what you say is strictly governed by societal
        rules. You automatically don&rsquo;t use prohibited or
        &ldquo;politically incorrect&rdquo; words. But what you say inside
        yourself, no one except you knows. The thoughts that you generate inside
        constitute your real worries.
      </p>

      <p>
        Khalil Gibran<sup id="how-does-worry-take-root-ref1"
          ><a href="#how-does-worry-take-root-1">1</a></sup
        >, a Lebanese poet, beautifully says, &ldquo;You talk when you cease to
        be at peace with your thoughts!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Our very verbalization
        is because we are not able to handle ourselves peacefully within
        us.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        It is like this: there is a continuous current of chatter happening in
        you twenty four hours a day, seven days a week. From this current a few
        spikes rise. These spikes are what you feel and express as worries.
        Worries are nothing but spikes in the current of thoughts constantly
        moving within you.
      </p>

      <p>
        These thoughts are mostly negative. That&rsquo;s the problem. If I ask you to
        write your life story in a few pages, you will write a few incidents
        highlighting how and when you struggled. You will not highlight the many
        joyful incidents that happened in between. The mind is trained to record
        only negative things. Even when something joyful happens, you remember
        only the moment when it ended, never the moments when you felt joy.
        Because even when you are at the peak of joy, you are always worrying
        about when the joy will end! The mind is trained from a very young age
        to think that life moves from one worry to the other or from one pain to
        another, never from one joy to another.
      </p>

      <p class="p-story">
        In a classroom, the teacher found that one boy was sitting with a very
        sad face.
      </p>

      <p class="p-story">
        She asked him, &ldquo;What happened? Why do you look so worried?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p class="p-story">
        The boy said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my parents. My dad works all day to provide good
        clothes and an excellent education for me. He buys me anything I want.
        My mother cooks the best food for me and takes care of me from morning
        until I go to bed.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p class="p-story">
        The teacher asked, &ldquo;Then what is your problem? Why are you worried?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p class="p-story">The boy replied, &ldquo;I am afraid they may run away.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>
        The mind has a clear identity only with pain, never with joy! That is
        why recalling even joyful moments becomes painful.
      </p>

      <p>
        Joy never gets recorded as thoughts, but pain does. That&rsquo;s why our
        internal recordings are always negative thoughts. Joy is like a blank
        recording! For example, if your entire life is like a time shaft, on
        that shaft the joyful moments are simply empty spaces! There won&rsquo;t be
        any recording corresponding to it. But the moments of worry and
        suffering will be clearly recorded as black impressions.
      </p>

      <p>
        On a beautiful white wall if there is a small black dot, and I ask you
        what you are able to see, what will you say? You will say you only see
        the black dot. You will not see the big white space surrounding it! That
        is how you conclude that your time shaft is only made up of worry and
        suffering.

      <h3>See what is as it IS - and move on</h3>

      <p>
        Buddha<sup id="see-what-is-as-it-is-and-move-on-ref1"
          ><a href="#see-what-is-as-it-is-and-move-on-1">1</a></sup
        >, an enlightened master, used the word <em>tathata</em> - seeing what is as it
        IS. It is seeing what is there as it is, without any judgment.
      </p>

      <p>
        But most of the time we see things only through our <em>worry</em>. When
        we see everything as it is, there is only joy, and when there is joy, no
        thoughts get recorded in you. There are only empty spaces. That is why
        when you are joyful you feel light, because nothing gets recorded. When
        you see everything through worry, more thoughts get recorded in you and
        you feel heavy.
      </p>

      <p>
        There is a common saying, &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t see things as they are. We see
        things as we are.&rdquo; If you feel there is something wrong with what you
        are seeing, then you should look back in at yourself because what you
        see outside is only a reflection of what is inside you. If you feel pure
        love inside, then you see only pure love outside. It always has to do
        with you, not with what you are seeing.
      </p>

      <p>
        How can you keep thoughts away from what truly IS? How can you enjoy
        each moment all the time?
      </p>

      <p>
        Try this small technique. When you see something, for example a person,
        or a situation, or a book, or anything, normally old thoughts and
        familiar reactions immediately rise in you. Bring in the awareness that
        these conditioned thoughts and memories cloud your judgment and
        visualize shattering those thoughts. Next, see the situation, or person,
        or object now with a fresh eye, as though you are seeing it for the
        first time! Suddenly you see how much you missed, because of your own
        worry and thoughts.
      </p>

      <p>
        Even when you see your husband, wife, brother, or anyone, look at them
        as though you are seeing them for the first time. Suddenly, you realize
        that not only does worry not arise, but also that you start seeing
        everyone alike, whether they are strangers or familiar to you. That is
        the right way. No one is familiar or unchanging. Even your wife is not
        known to you. Everyone is constantly changing every moment along with
        Existence. Only your mind is trying to make them appear to be permanent.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once you start seeing what is as it is, all your energy will integrate
        within you. There is no more worry, no more conflict. Worry arises
        because your thoughts resist what you see. Once the conflict disappears,
        all the energy invested in worry is released for you to integrate!
      </p>

      <p>
        Some one asked J. Krishnamurti<sup
          id="see-what-is-as-it-is-and-move-on-ref2"
          ><a href="#see-what-is-as-it-is-and-move-on-2">2</a></sup
        >, the famous Indian philosopher, how to fall in tune with what IS. He
        beautifully says, &ldquo;Just don&rsquo;t name it, you will find you are in tune
        with it!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Usually, when we see something, we either try to identify with it or we
        try to condemn it. For example, if you are told you are arrogant, you
        either accept it or you try not to be arrogant! You never understand or
        go beyond arrogance. You can only understand within your frame of
        reference, what you are familiar with. Because of this, you are caught
        in a limited view of possibilities. To really understand, you need to go
        beyond this limited point-of-view. To do that, you have to stop naming
        it arrogance, that&rsquo;s all! There will be no more arrogance. Only by
        naming it, you start the conflict. That is how you see what IS - by not
        naming it.
      </p>

      <p class="p-story">
        One man got onto a bus and sat down next to a young man. He could see
        that the man was a hippy. He was wearing only one shoe.
      </p>

      <p class="p-story">He asked him, &ldquo;You have lost one shoe?&rdquo;</p>

      <p class="p-story">
        The young man replied, &ldquo;No, I have found one shoe.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Stop naming any situation, person, or thing! Just see, that&rsquo;s all.
        Don&rsquo;t give room for condemning or accepting thoughts.
      </p>

      <p>
        Initially there&rsquo;s a compulsion to pass judgment on anything that
        you see because that is your habit. But when you experience the great
        energy released in you by seeing what IS, you want to remain that way -
        free from thoughts, worry, and suffering.
      </p>

      <p>
        When you see what is as it is, you are in heaven. When you want to see
        what you want to see, you are in hell. If you understand that everything
        is auspiciousness, you will drop expectation and see things as they are,
        because everything is auspiciousness.
      </p>

      <p>A small story:</p>

      <p class="p-story">
        One disciple kept asking the master, &ldquo;Master, where is
        paradise?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p class="p-story">
        Finally one day, the master asked him, &ldquo;Do you really want to
        know?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p class="p-story">The disciple sat up and said, &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;</p>

      <p class="p-story">
        The master said, &ldquo;Alright, my first disciple Hemachandra is in
        paradise.&rdquo; After saying these words the master closed his eyes and
        went into meditation.
      </p>

      <p class="p-story">
        The disciple knew it would be a long time before the master opened his
        eyes. So, he went and asked some of the disciples if they knew where
        Hemachandra lived. No one seemed to know.
      </p>

      <p class="p-story">
        Finally one disciple said, &ldquo;I know how to guide you there, but I
        have never been there myself. It is in a deep valley beyond a range of
        ice covered mountains.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p class="p-story">
        The disciple wrote down the directions carefully and went back to the
        master. He told him, &ldquo;Master, I wish to pay a visit to
        Hemachandra!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p class="p-story">
        The master was absorbed deeply in some work. Without even looking up he
        said, &ldquo;Go ahead.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p class="p-story">
        The disciple started on his journey. He walked for many days, passing
        through sun, rain, snow, and what not. He became exhausted, on the verge
        of death. It took him one hundred days to reach the valley. When he
        finally reached it he looked at the valley and thought, &ldquo;This
        valley doesn&rsquo;t look all that great. I have seen many more
        beautiful valleys. Why did the master call this paradise?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p class="p-story">
        He looked around and walked further and finally found
        Hemachandra&rsquo;s hut. Hemachandra was very pleased to see him. He
        served him food and asked how the master and other disciples were doing.
      </p>

      <p class="p-story">
        All along, the disciple was thinking to himself, &ldquo;Master called
        this place paradise? I can&rsquo;t believe it.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        After a week-long stay he left and returned to his master. It took him
        another one hundred days to return home.
      </p>

      <p class="p-story">
        He went straight to the master and stated, &ldquo;You said that the
        place is paradise. But what I saw was the most ordinary place
        ever!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p class="p-story">
        The master said, &ldquo;Oh god! At the time of your enquiry, had you
        been more explicit about your intention, I would have told you the
        truth.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p class="p-story">
        The disciple asked, &ldquo;What is the truth?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p class="p-story">
        The master replied, &ldquo;Hemachandra is not in paradise. Paradise is
        in him!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        When you live close to Existence, without any expectation, seeing what
        is as it is and finding the blessings in it, you will carry heaven in
        you! Heaven is not geographical, it is psychological. It is not
        physical, it is mental. If you decide, you can be in heaven right now.
      </p>

      <p>
        Many people get worried about what they see in their dreams and come to
        me for interpretations. I tell them that we are unable to even accept
        what happens in reality, then why bother about what happens in our
        dreams?
      </p>

      <p class="p-story">
        One day, a man dreamt a strange dream and became very curious to know
        what the dream meant. He went to his master, told him about the dream
        and asked for an explanation.
      </p>

      <p class="p-story">
        The master told him, &ldquo;Come to me with dreams that come to you in
        your wakeful state. We will work them out. The dreams of your sleep
        belong neither to my wisdom, nor to your imagination.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        If you are still worried about your dreams, you should know that dreams
        tell you about the state of your mind during the day. Learn from your
        dreams and think how to transform the mind during the daytime. For
        example, if you think too much about lust when you are awake, your
        dreams will be lustful. If you worry too much about passing with high
        grades, you will write exams in your dreams! If you worry too much about
        relationships, you will fight with someone in your dream. So wake up to
        what your dreams indicate to you. There is nothing more to interpret
        from your dreams. Wake up and see what is as it IS.

      <h3>Worry - a legacy passed down</h3>

      <p>
        Worry is an unwanted legacy passed down from grandparents to parents to
        children. Children are like sponges. They simply absorb the body
        language and attitude of the parents. The parents are not even aware
        this is happening. For example, if a child hears the mother repeating a
        certain worry four or five times, the child simply internalizes the
        habit. He grows up repeating statements unnecessarily, which is one
        attribute of worry.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ultimately he carries the worry with him into marriage and then both he
        and his wife must deal with it, even though it was originally his
        mother&rsquo;s concern. They will then hand it down to their children,
        unless they stop naming it and learn to live with what IS.
      </p>

      <p class="p-story">
        A man was pushing his baby in a pram. The baby was screaming at the top
        of his voice. All the while the man kept repeating quietly, &ldquo;Keep
        calm George. Don&rsquo;t scream. It will be okay.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p class="p-story">His wife told him to keep quiet.</p>

      <p class="p-story">
        A woman who was watching this said to the wife, &ldquo;Why are you so
        rude to him? He is really doing his best to pacify your son!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p class="p-story">
        The wife looked at her with resentment, pointed to her husband and told
        her, &ldquo;He is George.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        When parents express constant worry, children grow up thinking life goes
        on only because of worry! Understand that life goes on not because of
        us, but in spite of us!
      </p>

      <p class="p-story">
        One man had just moved into a remote part of a village. One day, he was
        seen throwing handfuls of bread crumbs around his house.
      </p>

      <p class="p-story">
        His neighbor who was watching him asked him, &ldquo;What are you
        doing?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p class="p-story">
        The man replied, &ldquo;I am keeping the tigers away.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p class="p-story">
        The neighbor was surprised. He said, &ldquo;But there are no tigers in
        these parts!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p class="p-story">
        The man replied, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Very effective, isn&rsquo;t
        it?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        This is how we are trained to worry! The other day, I read a survey
        about worries. It said that forty percent of the things we worry about
        never happen, thirty percent are in the past and can&rsquo;t be helped,
        twelve percent concern the affairs of others that are not our business,
        ten percent are about illnesses that are mostly imagined, eight percent
        are worth worrying about but they are also not worth the energy to
        worry. They can be overcome by simply putting faith into action. So
        really, zero percent of our worries are worth the effort!
      </p>

      <p>
        People will believe anything that is said with statistics! So I am
        talking with statistics. Otherwise, just one line is enough: don&rsquo;t
        worry, just do. Things will happen as they should!
      </p>

      <p>
        The problem is that parents expect their children to worry! If they
        don&rsquo;t worry, they brand them as uncaring. It is possible to care
        without worrying. Care is <em>doing</em>, worry is <em>chattering</em>.
        There is no use chattering. Chattering is like trying to cross a bridge
        before it comes.
