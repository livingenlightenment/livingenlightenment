# Meditation â€“ feel the Love overflowing in you

Sit down comfortably by yourself and close
your eyes.

Focus on your heart region. Exclude
everything else. Focus only on the heart.

Visualize your heart as an endless reservoir
from where blessings can flow.

Feel every heartbeat deeply. Let every beat
resound throughout you.

Between the heartbeats, feel the energy of
love happening.

In the deepest parts of your body, mind
and soul, the love energy is waiting to be
acknowledged.

Invite the love energy of the heart to flow
and fill these deepest parts of your body,
mind and soul.

Slowly open your eyes.
