# Ego disconnects - Love connects

If the cosmos is a grand ocean, we are all
part of it. We are one with the ocean, not
individual drops in the ocean. When we
think of ourselves as individual drops, we
feel separate in our boundary and in our
feelings. This is what is called ego. We
become driven by feelings of ‘I’ and ‘mine’.
As long as this separation remains, we
never experience the energy of the ocean
that is love, we can never experience that
causeless and surging love.

As long as we remain a drop in the ocean,
we say ‘no’ to life. We neither love nor
trust. We don’t feel blissful either because
bliss is possible only for those who know
how to love and trust. It happens only to
those who know how to feel part of the
ocean. Bliss is possible only when our heart
says ‘yes’, when the ‘no’ completely
disappears from our being. ‘No’ is darkness,
‘yes’ is light. ‘No’ is ego, ‘yes’ is egolessness.

‘No’ is the way
of the
unconscious
person. ‘Yes’ is
the way of the awakened one. All the
conflict, all the suffering in our life is
because of our saying ‘no’. ‘No’ is a fight,
a war with Existence. ‘Yes’ is love, peace
with Existence. ‘Yes’ is deep accord with
the totality of who we are – the ocean.
Bliss is another name for that accord, that
harmony.

The way to be in bliss is to dissolve into
the ocean, not to be a drop but to merge
with the ocean. To be a drop is to be with
ego. The ego is the root of all misery. When
the ego is absent, bliss reaches us from
every nook and corner of the ocean of
existence, as if it were just waiting for the
ego to disappear.

Ego is a closed state of consciousness. All
the windows and doors are closed. Life
itself becomes insulated and encapsulated.
Our ego surrounds us like a capsule. Our
ego is like a sealed capsule; there is not
even a small gap to allow anything to enter.
It closes itself due to fear and shrinks into
itself. That is how we create misery for
ourselves.

Love is being in the flow with Existence,
to be totally with it. Ego is like frozen ice.
Love is like liquid water. Only when we
are liquid do we become part of the ocean.
Then we don’t have any private goal or
destination. Each moment is blissful,
incredibly ecstatic, just
going with the plan of the cosmos.

The mind is part of the ego. It knows how
to close, but it does not know how to open.
To love means to open up, to surrender. It
means opening up to Existence, to the
flowers, to the bees and to the stars. How
do we open to this beautiful music that
fills the whole of Existence? How do we
open up to this celebration that goes on
and on – flowers dancing in the wind, trees
enjoying the wind and the stars, always in
a state of bliss? Except for man, everything
else seems to be in harmony.

Man falls out of harmony because he has
what is called ‘consciousness’ which is not
present in other living creatures.

Consciousness can do two things. It can
create ego or it can create egolessness. If
it creates ego, we live in hell. If it creates
egolessness, we live in paradise. The whole
world is in paradise without knowing it.
When man enters paradise, he enters
knowing it fully. That is the grandeur and
beauty of man. That is the danger as well,
because it is easier to fall into the trap of
the ego and not enter into paradise than to
enter paradise knowingly.

The problem is that we have forgotten who
we are and for what we were created. We
are emperors of love, but we dream that
we are beggars. We have the whole
kingdom of Existence within our being
and yet we continue to beg for mundane
things. We keep collecting mundane things
not knowing that we have infinite,
inexhaustible treasures within our being.
We are oceans, yet we are thirsty because
we have become disconnected from our
own selves. But no matter how
disconnected we are, no matter how much
we have forgotten and how long we have
forgotten, it can be remembered in a single
moment and we can become connected
immediately.

Love is the connector.

Bliss arises from love. Love is the poetry
that connects you back to Existence. Love
is the sword that slays the ego and merges
you with the ocean. When the heart is full
of love, your whole life is transformed
from prose to poetry, from noise to music
and from discord to harmony.

It is such sheer joy to simply exist. Just ‘to
be’ is enough. But we need to be sensitive
to feel the joy of being. We need to grow
feelers. The feelers are what we call love.
Love feels the joy of just being. When you
grow the feelers of love, life is no longer
made of independent thoughts but
becomes a continuous feeling. Then the
ego starts to dissolve. Once we have moved
from thinking to feeling, there is only one
more step and that is from feeling to being.
That is very simple.

The first step is difficult, to move from
thinking to feeling. The ego has trained the
mind to think so much, that’s why. The
second step comes almost automatically.
There’s nothing we need to do for it to
happen. From feeling to being, the distance
is nothing at all. It can happen at any
moment. The poet can become the mystic
at any moment. He is almost there. The
real problem is how to get out of our
thinking and get more and more into
feeling.

Just follow the heart. Just love more, that’s
all! Feel more. Enjoy more so that you can
feed your heart. Watch the sunrise, sunset,
clouds, rainbows, birds, flowers, animals,
rocks, and people, and watch them with
awareness. Look into their eyes. Existence
is so multidimensional. Look into every
dimension like a poet. Praise it. Feel it. Be
ecstatic! Expand your consciousness and
experience every single detail of Existence
with love. Slowly, the ego will lose its hold
and disappear.

The only barrier to love is fear. When things
start happening, we become fearful
because with love we enter into a merger.
This threatens the very basis of our ego.
Ego is separateness while love is a merger.
The fear we feel is nothing but the fear of
the dissolving ego. Let the fear be there. It
will hang
around for a
while. If we
simply ignore
it, the ego will
leave us. It is a
great day when fear of losing the ego leaves
us. From then on growth becomes simple,
easy and spontaneous. Then _we_ are not,
only _love_ is.
